Christians,,15srna6,WordandFreedom,"""post_title"": Christian women, God doesn't want you to stay anxious, sick, poor or depressed.

""post_content"": So many Christian women are struggling with anxiety, fear, depression, ill health or lack of finances, and it feels so overwhelming. Yet, God wants you to experience His peace, divine health, wealth and so much more. I wanted to share a free scripture guide, that includes scriptures on various topics so that you can overcome in those areas. As you meditate on these scriptures and allow the Lord to speak the understanding of those scriptures to your heart, you will begin to receive so much more from God.
