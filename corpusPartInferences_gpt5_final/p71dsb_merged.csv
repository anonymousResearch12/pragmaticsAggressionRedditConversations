SuicideWatch,2021-08-19 00:18:35,h9glqqi,MarineRitter,"Comedy is there for that exact reason. Modern societies don't have court jesters, we forgot that we're not supposed to take life so seriously. I'm far too curious and interested in a million stuff to ever want to die, but whenever my time comes, I'll accept it wholeheartedly. Life is like music or dancing, you don't live to get to a certain point, you live to enjoy the process. You don't dance to arrive at a certain spot in the room, you dance to dance.

What I was trying to get at is that in the stresses and the general overinformation in modern age it's tough to remember to just take a moment of considering yourself compared to your environment. Considering comedy as opposed to sorrow.

I didn't give any practical advice because I'm not educated nor certified to give it, but I can share my thought process with a fellow human being.

The first step of working on depression is admitting it exists and identifying with roots, but it's hard to get anywhere if you allow yourself to identify yourself with your depression.

That's exactly what aggravates depression in people.. seeing people who claim to be happy/normal behave this way with those who struggle. Fuck a world where he can delude himself into thinking he's a good person, while others like us feel like bad guys for just existing. Is that really what were trying to build up to? 

At the same time, you can use people like that as motivation to actually help others as you likely have a better understanding of what most users on here are going through. 

Even if your compassion and other emotions are numbed, they can still have a positive impact on others. 

What makes it all worth it? Idk I haven't found it yet &amp; I've been trying my whole life. Just seems like all you can do is distract yourself until you can't anymore. That's the cycle. 

For me..
