""post_content"": I hate blacks.

You all say that it's wrong. 

I ask how is it in my interest to not be racist when my being racist has been a wonderful thing. I've never been robbed by one. My neighborhood is nice and clean because I refuse to live with them just like Bernie Sanders. 

So why shouldn't I be racist?",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Treats racial outgroup avoidance as personally beneficial, inferring that segregation yields safety/cleanliness."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 92}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Assumes anecdotal non-harm (never robbed) justifies global negative stereotypes about Black people."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Frames morality as subordinate to self-interest and seeks instrumental reasons to abandon racism."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 88}, ""4"": {""content"": ""Invokes a public figure (Bernie Sanders) to suggest hypocrisy and normalize racial avoidance."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""5"": {""content"": ""Requests validation or refutation for being openly racist (provocative, possibly trolling)."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 78}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,OAG

confessions,2024-01-07 12:46:01,kgpxbet,Peaceful_Browsing,"It just feels like a waste of energy to hate an entire group of people just because of the color of their skin.

Let's pretend you aren't a troll and just answer honestly.

1. Racism is illegal if its manifested in the work place. You're not allowed to discriminate based on race. If you use your misguided judgement against blacks to make any decisions in your work place, you've become a legal liability for whatever organization you're with.

2. Adding racism to any crime makes it a hate crime, which just adds a new offense on top of whatever you're already facing.

3. Limited opportunities. People who don't live with a fear of black people aren't afraid to stand next to one of them in line, or work with one of them, or walk through a black neighborhood. Racists are on edge in these situations because you have a baked-in bias that tells you these people are dangerous based on the color of their skin.

4. If it's not a skin-tone thing and you're just using out-of-context crime statistics, then you're also ignoring whites and Latinos raised in similar socioeconomic environments. If you have a bias against blacks because you believe they're the ones who commit all the crimes, you make yourself an easy target when a white conman pulls one over on you. We can see this with religion, when people automatically assume people who are ""like them"" (i.e. in their congregation) can be trusted, then get screwed over when doing business.

5. This one probably doesn't matter to you, but you're just cutting yourself off from a unique subculture that's pretty fun to participate in. I'm white, and I have black friends. We make jokes, we have fun. They're *people*. And every friend I make makes me a happier, more fulfilled person. If I decided not to include people with certain skin colors in my friend group, I'd be markedly more miserable.

Again, this is assuming you aren't a troll. But let's be real... This is a troll. I've met racists.
