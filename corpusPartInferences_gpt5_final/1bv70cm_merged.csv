I’ve never been suspended myself and I’ve said some wild shit, but I know it happens. The safest thing I think is do definitely try and stick to just the fantasy and role playing and avoid sharing pictures and personal information if you want to mitigate your chances of being suspended. 

I don’t know of any communities outside of Reddit, but I’m also not super invested in this kink.
