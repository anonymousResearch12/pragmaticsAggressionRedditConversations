""Inter-government efforts"" sounds suspiciously like Orwellian Newsspeak. Read ""totalitarian world government"".

Classic fear-mongering. ""We've got ~~12~~, ~~10~~, 7 years!"" Heard it all before.

It is in the world’s best interest that all nations cease aggressions, even if just for a decade or so, so that we all may turn our resources to securing the lives of our peoples.

At least Anony Mee realizes this climate change is natural, and more energy not less may prevent starvation. Being a farmer myself for 40 years and seeing what the extreme weather swings are doing, I agree with most of what he is saying. Here in Saskatchewan we produce 35 percent of the worlds pulse crops that are exported. Canadian Production of canola, wheat and pulses dropped by about 40% overall in 2021. Most of the farmland in western Canada still has not had enough rain to replenish the deficient moisture reserves. The rain or snow that usually might arrive from the Pacific Ocean has been dumped on the coastal areas of BC and Washington. The main transportation links to Vancouver have been destroyed by overrun rivers and there is little let up in sight. Urea fertilizer may be in short supply in 2022 further lowering potential production. It might be better to subsidize farmers than run out of food. Urea has tripled in price since last spring.
I might add that trucking freight to haul food to Vancouver has tripled, as trucks from Saskatchewan have to travel via Seattle Washington.",hoaljw5,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Claims climate variability is natural while emphasizing severe production impacts from extreme weather."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 82}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Advocates policy support (e.g., subsidies) and reliable energy to prevent food shortages."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Establishes credibility via long-term farming experience to validate claims."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 83}}",3,representatives,yes,PRE,NAG

climateskeptics,2021-12-15 00:57:35,hokubhr,Extra_Conversation12,"My take on the weather in this area of Canada is mainly how the cycles of rain and sun have gone from being about 5 weeks to much longer covering large geographical areas. Tim Ball a climatologist said in the mid 90’s that our jet stream typically moved in a wave that created about 5 weeks on average either sun or unsettled rain/showers. Now we are getting more randomness. When it rains now we have sometimes got 15-20 inches in a week or 2, then minimal rain for 2 years. The drought in North America now goes from California to all of the Canadian prairies, with only a few small areas having sufficient ground moisture reserves, for a good start to 2022. I suspect 95 percent of the grain grown on the Canadian prairies is on dry land where the USA would have much more. In 2020 the heat wave broke all time records for maximums and length of time.

Climate scientists who do research on the impact of the Grand Solar Minimum have concluded that the cooling is small (between -0.08-0.4%) compared to the warming produced by the greenhouse effect over the next couple of decades:

&gt;subsidies for all the green projects

If the IPCC is right and North American farmers and food production are threatened by more extreme weather over the next decades and centuries, those subsidies should go to those farmers to help them transition to an emissions-free food production.

The reasoning behind it is that as long as we emit greenhouse gases, the planet will keep getting warmer.
