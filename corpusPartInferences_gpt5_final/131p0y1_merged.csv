The truth is we felt left out with you guys in Yugoslavia having fun in the 90s and not including us. So we decided to start killing each other. It was mostly in the south of the country. It started due to the poor economy and a pyramid scheme that took all the savings already poor Albanians had. Greece thought this crisis would be great to cause even more stir in the south so they released from prison in Greece some really bad Albanian guys who returned to the south and ended up causing the death of hundreds thinking they could run towns with the threat of violence. Quite a few women were trafficked into prostitution so families stopped sending girls to school or outside on their own until the situation normalized.",131p0y1,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Corrects the timeline, asserting the key unrest was in 1997."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Uses dark humor to depict the chaos as self-inflicted Balkan \u2018fun\u2019."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Attributes the trigger to economic collapse and pyramid schemes devastating the poor."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 85}, ""4"": {""content"": ""Alleges Greek meddling by releasing criminals who worsened violence in southern Albania."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 70}, ""5"": {""content"": ""Highlights gendered harms (trafficking) and protective restrictions on girls\u2019 mobility."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 75}}",2,expressives,yes,IMP,NAG

AskBalkans,2023-04-29 10:05:35,ji5t113,tnilk,"A lot of people had invested their money into companies which were later found out to be pyramid schemes.

When the news got out and people were denied their money, violent protests broke out mostly in the south. 

There was a lot of political nuance to this, a few ex-gang members escaped from ""high-security"" Greek prisons. They eventually regrouped and taking advantage of the situation turned into road bandits, some eventually taking hold of cities.

The official statement from Greece was that they would enter Albania to protect their minorities, which was later referred to as the ""Liberation of Vorio-Epirus"". Turkey threatened they'd attack Athens if Greece did that.

The oposition at that time created so called ""Salvation commities"", their main goal to usurp the state. A lot of military personnel defacted.

The government back then panicked, decided to open up military depots as their response and a lot of people ended up owning weapons.

This eventually led to new elections and the country was later stabilized, and most of the responsible groups were apprehended and are still serving their sentence.

The general consensus would depend on who you're asking, mostly the south was affected, people in other parts of the country were just broke and afraid of stray bullets by the occasional dumbass who'd gotten hold of a gun.",ji2i8s2,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Frames the unrest as fallout from mass pyramid schemes and financial collapse."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Claims Greek prison escapes and banditry aggravated state lawlessness."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 75}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Describes state failure: opposition committees, defections, and mass armament."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 85}, ""4"": {""content"": ""Emphasizes the south suffered most while others lived in fear of stray violence."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""5"": {""content"": ""Asserts eventual stabilization via elections and prosecutions."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 80}}",4,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
