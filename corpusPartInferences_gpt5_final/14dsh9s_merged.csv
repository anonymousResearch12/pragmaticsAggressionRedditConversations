Of course, it‘s not something most people are extremely open about, but I feel like I’d pick up on these things better than most. I never endured significant trauma before I remember these fantasies really taking off. I don’t know what brought on these thoughts, really. I had sadistic fantasies that were sexually motivated since before I knew what sex or kinks were at all. That said, I know sadomasochism isn’t horrifically uncommon. I have heard very brief stories that my uncle was perverted and had many sexual partners, but ehhh that was from my father who thinks masochists are a horrifically disturbing concept. On top of that I have an obsessive personality, and attachment issues.
