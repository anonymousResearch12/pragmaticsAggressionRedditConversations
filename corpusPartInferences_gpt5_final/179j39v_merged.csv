“Why is Israel not opening a Humanitarian corridor for the people of Gaza to try and help them? 

Hamas would certainly attack any assistance efforts.  The bombed the field hospital Israel set up for Gazans.

“Many international experts condemned Israel”

And what else is new?

“Why does Israeli law only reconise Jewish pre-1948/ pre-6 days war claims to properties in Sheikh Jarrah/ East Jerusalem, but rejects Arab claims?”

Probably has something to do with Arabs being their sworn enemies.  

“do Israelis sees the images of dead palestinians, child dead palestinians, and the monts of corpses arriving at Al-Aqsa hospital?”

Probably, but I’m guessing their minds are still focused on their own dead children purposely murdered.

“Certainly they would want to know what is happening at Gaza, right?”
