uberdrivers,,143ocnt,bandofwarriors,"""post_title"": $2.21 on $42.50

""post_content"": Just picked up and order that had a 1 mile delivery for $2.21 just for the hell of it.
When I deliver the order which took 10 minutes to find the person, I handed them their order and as I was handing it off I noticed the total on the receipt.. $42.53
So that's how they're doing this on UberEats guys... If you didn't already know.

Flimsy logic I know, but it seems like it works sometimes.
