""post_content"": Almost no one actually thinks that all criticisms of Israel are anti-semitism, not even Zionists.

Are you joking? It's incredibly commonplace, my friend.

No one's really claiming that zionists think Israel is completely, 100% perfect. That's not an unpopular opinion. It just seems like you're ignoring the actual situation to play with words.

&gt;Also, you do know that, ""I hate zionists, they're all monsters. If you identify as a zionist, your evil"" isn't a criticism of Israel right?
