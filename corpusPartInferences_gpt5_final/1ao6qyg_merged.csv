This is not just in India, it’s happening across the world with active funding from China, and is no conspiracy theory as media outlets themselves declared how much funding the get from Communists and Dictatorships, including universities as well, where death chants like “from river to the sea” are openly used by Harvard students.

I have made an entire post on why “Hindu Nationalism” is a wrong term for “Dharmic Revivalism”, and this mindset of fake oppression is used to create divide which isn’t good for any aspect of it can lead to civil wars as explained by **Robert Spencer’s 2023 book “The Sumter Gambit: How the Left Is Trying to Foment a Civil War”.**

Additionally you can go through this lecture by ex-KGB agent to learn how subversion is used first hand.

IndiaSpeaks,2024-02-11 13:48:17,kpx7blc,TheOffChutzpah,"It exists in every country.

If you are talking about religion per se, reddit consists of a very polar opposite spectrum of people. You will either get the best or the worst. In reality it is different (though problems do exist even).

The minority plays the victim card - most of the time. Be it religion, caste, special status etc. Take for example the demolition of religious places in Mehrauli, New Delhi. One mosque, 2 Shiva temples, 1 Kali temple and 1 Hanuman temple were razed by the DDA after discussing the matter with the respective religious committees (including Muslims) since 2020. They served notice and went on with the demolition drive. Nobody raised an objection. The mosque was an old one but ASI didn't mind it. Can you guess who is crying about it? The minority. They are crying and asking as if they wanted the notice to be served to each and every person of the faith (stupid). Also, the mosque had extended the construction beyond what the ASI had marked in 1922.

The land was bought by DDA from private owners years ago. So, the rule is you can do whatever you want to do with your land. To begin with, do not live on land you don't own (not talking about the orphaned kids who lived there) but the owners who decided that it was their own. Can you just start construction of a house anywhere you want? Now, the entire community is speaking ill, bringing in religion and the propaganda machine has started. BBC has done a piece, the left media is calling the BJP (though it happened in Delhi by DDA).

You can see how this resentment arises among the majority and it becomes very easy for the minority to feel the pain. Also read about what is happening in Uttarakhand. Do NOT read illogical news mindlessly based on religion. Read when and what the state government asked, who were the participants and etc. And how the minority community fuel it.",1ao6qyg,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Normalizes majoritarianism as universal while portraying minorities as frequently 'playing the victim card.'"", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.87}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Uses a demolition case to frame minority/media reactions as propagandistic and unfair."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.84}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Advises against consuming 'illogical' religion-framed news, implying misinformation drives minority grievances."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.78}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,CAG

Reality is this, minorities are safe in India, safer than most western nations, and it is a teaching in Hinduism not to just live side by side with humans but all living things and nature as well. The fear you hold is irrational as you’ve demonstrated lack of reason to justify it and the will to learn about reality.
