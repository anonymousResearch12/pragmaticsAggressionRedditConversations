SuicideWatch,2024-08-12 12:06:28,lhq12i6,SadMonkey2024,"I‚Äôm confused by the OP‚Äôs post.  You opened by disclosing that you are suicidal due to ‚Äúextensive abuse.‚Äù You then disclosed that you transitioned 4 years ago.  You also mentioned another reason for suicidal ideations was ‚Äúclimate change.‚Äù You wrote you had an outdated suicidal plan but have now updated it. You explicitly asked for help ‚Äútalking you down‚Äù because you are afraid you might choose this new plan without any thought. 

An anonymous friend advised that things could improve and volunteered to help you but you questioned whether help was even relevant given that state of climate change. The anonymous friend advised that climate change was real but gave their opinion that we can live through it and do the best we can without allowing this global catastrophe to bring your entire existence as a human to be negative.  

Speaking of trauma and healing, you then stated ‚ÄúThere is no happiness in trauma. There is no happiness in healing trauma. There is only suffering until maybe magically it heals. So why watch the world get worse when it has already proven so cruel?‚Äù Your anonymous friend advised you that the whole world could not be cruel writing ‚ÄúThe world can‚Äôt be all that cruel,  people are trying to help you that has to count for something. Some people fight for others rights thats good. Some people love unconditionally that‚Äôs good. People are still trying to fix somethings that are wrong thats has to be good.‚Äù

Concerning your view on trauma, I‚Äôll have to add that I‚Äôve suffered from PTSD for 34 years stemming from childhood abuse. With the help of my psychiatrist, counselor, family and friends, I have learned how to successfully navigate these serious periods of paranoia; panic/PTSD attacks, night terrors and vivid dreaming. After working on these issues with professionals for years, I have found extended periods of happiness and joy. I continue weekly therapy. 

Somehow you pivoted to any progress towards good was negated by bad. From there you implied that we live in a ‚Äúrape culture‚Äù and implied the helpers in this form were possibly predators. To this I say, so what if some are predators. Can they not contribute value after having paid for their crimes. But seriously, if a sex offender is here, what are they getting out of these anonymous conversations. I‚Äôm personally disgusted by your baseless allegations when people are just on here to help you out of their free time for asking nothing in return. 

Then out of the blue, another person questioned you about how climate change in general is motivating you to plan suicide since you mentioned serious problems from your past that can be discussed. I‚Äôm concerned about climate change but it‚Äôs not something I can do anything about on my iPad at 6am. I don‚Äôt like your response to this 2nd person who tried to help you. Name calling with implied allegations of wrongdoing. 

I don‚Äôt know and have never spoken or wrote to these two selfless individuals who tried to assist you this morning. I understand you are hurting and may have lashed out in pain but I would not try to bite the hand that‚Äôs trying to help you. We are all hurting people who are hurting. Some of us are hurting and trying to overcome the hurt by helping others the best we can. 

I do respect you for reaching out on here to get some help from another human. It takes courage. I don‚Äôt wish for you to take your own life. My only wish for you is to find professional help and work hard to regain the happiness in your life that was taken you. It will be hard but you can always write on here and someone will try to help you even though many of us are struggling ourselves.",1eq7rns,"{""1"": {""content"": ""They claim happiness is recoverable with sustained professional support, citing personal PTSD recovery."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 88}, ""2"": {""content"": ""They condemn the OP\u2019s predator insinuations about helpers as baseless and insulting."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""3"": {""content"": ""They advise the OP to seek professional help and stop lashing out at people trying to assist."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 84}, ""4"": {""content"": ""They suggest that even offenders who paid for crimes might still contribute value."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 70}}",2,representatives,no,IMP,CAG
