""post_content"": Anyone whoâ€™s doing their first listen to this thing whilst doing something else, like anything else like even if ur scrolling through your phone, putting some clothes away, going to the gym. Stop. Stop listening and wait for a better time. I can 100% guarantee youâ€™re gonna get so much more from this album if you set some time aside to only just listen to the album. Lie down in your bed, close your eyes, stick this on with some good headphones, and really feel the music.

A lot of ppl donâ€™t try hard enough, if they just stick in there, even if it requires some effort, itâ€™ll transform how they hear music, not just for this album.
