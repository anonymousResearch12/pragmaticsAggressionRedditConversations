Everyone is different everyone's journey is different

Be happy that you have recognised that watching p*** is a problem

What I would recommend you to do is is to set a goal of a short period of time

If you can't reach past 24 hours then try setting goals in hours

I am not saying that you can't set goals in days if you want to you can set your goal in days as well

But it will be better for you to start off small then go to higher numbers",ldweep,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Advises self-compassion over self-blame to reduce shame."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Recommends incremental goal-setting (hours to days) to build self-efficacy."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Normalizes individual variability in recovery ('everyone's journey is different')."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 82}, ""4"": {""content"": ""Validates the premise that porn is a problem worth addressing."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 74}}",2,directives,yes,IMP,NAG
