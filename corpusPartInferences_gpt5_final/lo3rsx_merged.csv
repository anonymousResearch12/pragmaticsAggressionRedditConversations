""post_content"": What do you think of this idea? 

I mean the goal is to get a real date but I'm just not ready for that and as a 28 years old virgin with mental issues I'll probably never get a date not to say a successful date.

NoFap,2021-02-20 11:04:11,go3v33e,Kashr90,"Not good to pay. Because you will use that as your escape and pay again and again. 

I think you should aim for a GF. 

And aim to recondition or fix your mental issues asap. Do everything you can from today to fix those issues or make it small enough to be able to date.

Because your day 47 meaning you have every power to attract a wonderful girl for you. You shown you have discipline and that in itself brings its own rewards.",lo3rsx,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Paying for sex will reinforce avoidance and become a repeating escape."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 86}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Advises pursuing a girlfriend and actively addressing mental health."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Believes NoFap-derived discipline confers power/attractiveness to find a partner."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 80}}",3,representatives,no,IMP,NAG
