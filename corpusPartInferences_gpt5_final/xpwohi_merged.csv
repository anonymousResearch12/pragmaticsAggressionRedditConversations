confessions,,xpwohi,B1tter-Life,"""post_title"": I compliment my clingy girl

""post_content"": She is as clingy as flat-earthers are cringe, which means very!

She always wants my attention. She always wants to be near me. She always wants to know what I’m doing.

She literally squeals and squirms in happiness when I compliment her.

She hides and cries for hours when I yell at her.

She always craves my approval for everything.

But I love it!

I compliment her for being clingy and it makes her glow from happiness. She had never been complimented for being herself before!

I’m happy.

confessions,2022-09-28 14:00:21,iq83zpv,B1tter-Life,"Hey, thank you for your response! I understand that you are concerned, your sensitivity serves you well.

I am familiar with mental illnesses. Don’t worry, she is well taken care of.

I like treating her with intense affection because it makes her squeal from happiness. It really is beautiful when she is so happy.

She knows she is safe with me. She tells me everything on her mind, she literally shares her thoughts with me - no walking on eggshells, no filtering things to check if they’re socially appropriate.

You say you have PTSD, yourself. I sympathize with your struggles. Trauma can feel like something was stolen from you - your childhood, your dignity, your autonomy, your safety and happiness. And mild things easily cause all this misery to resurface, e.g. being yelled at. You feel like the world is ending, a sensation of disaster.

This is not how it should be. No one deserves that. I understand your concerns.
