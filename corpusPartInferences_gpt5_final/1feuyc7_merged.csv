AskIndia,,1feuyc7,flybirdie0045,"""post_title"": I need a job which is possible only after my brother recommendation. But he hates me. Please advise me on how to remove the hatred he has towards me, so he will recommend my name when time comes. 

""post_content"": I am overage for this job and my brother has said that he will recommend my name after my training gets over.  But I doubt he will recommend me because he hates ne internally a lot. I don't know why he does, bit he hates. Actually he hates every member of this family. 
Please advise what should I do to make him more favorable towards me when my time comes. Like when I need recommendation.
