Masturbation and ejaculation haven't been shown to have any long-term or negative effects on testosterone levels. 

>It's scientifically proven that balls are linked to the brain.

Every part of your body is linked to the brain. That's how human bodies work.

>Monks who want to have control over their mind are celibate.

Not all monks do so. Japanese Buddist monks marry have have sex just like normal people, because they believe the strongest minds can have control over their body regardless of the activities they engage in. Only the weak run away from temptations.
