NoFap,2021-02-09 04:12:09,gmnoyqo,GambinosDisciple,"In my experience of no fap, the only way it's worth it is if you're devotedly working on something (eg: gym, school, sports, self-improvement). If you don't have any real ambitions in life atm, and you just want to do nofap for the sake of it, you'll find yourself more stressed than relieved or productive. However, if you have big plans and are challenging yourself daily, your motivation, performance, and focus will absolutely rocket. Again, I'm talking from personal experience, but many people agree with this, hopefully you can make something out of my testament.",lfsls3,"{""1"": {""content"": ""NoFap is worthwhile mainly as an instrument to serve larger ambitions; otherwise it may increase stress without productivity gains."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 88}, ""2"": {""content"": ""When paired with challenging goals, abstinence can boost motivation, performance, and focus."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 85}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Advice: don\u2019t do NoFap \u2018for its own sake\u2019; use it strategically to support concrete projects."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 82}, ""4"": {""content"": ""Anecdotal evidence and perceived community consensus are treated as credible support."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 70}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
