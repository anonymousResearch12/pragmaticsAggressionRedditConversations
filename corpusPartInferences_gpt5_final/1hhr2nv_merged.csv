""post_content"": See, in my head, im a functioning addict
The biggest reason why i don’t really care to stop my addiction is because i don’t see a point in dating in this generation.. i’ve had girlfriends before, and the sex was great, but after getting cheated on and actually helping a girl cheat once, i cant find myself trusting women…

You can be a fireman, as well as excel in other areas of life. Start a business outside of work hours. Work on that as well as being a fireman. Work on becoming financially free so you can properly raise your future children with little financial restriction and/or stresses. However, money isn’t everything. Work on building yourself from the ground up as a new man. A strong, disciplined man. Not one that indulges in watching porn and jerking himself off because it just feels good. So what. Who cares. Heroin feels good too. Heroin addicts will argue you can be a functioning heroin addict too. Just saying.

If you want to be the best father you can in the future, it starts with giving up porn ASAP. No good father watches porn behind his family’s backs. Learn to control yourself and your fleshly desires.
