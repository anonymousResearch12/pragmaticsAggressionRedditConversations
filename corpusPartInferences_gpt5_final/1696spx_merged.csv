TrueUnpopularOpinion,,1696spx,AbyssWankerArtorias,"""post_title"": The only rights you have are the ones you're willing to fight and die for.

""post_content"": Many rights we take for granted are ones we only have because the people that survived the conflict believed in them and passed down those values. Freedom of speech is only a right in western countries because the people that fought for it passed down that value. 

Your rights aren't something you'll have no matter what and eventually, someone may try to take them from you. The only thing that will decide if you maintain that right is who has the stronger conviction and more resources to act on that conviction.",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Rights are contingent on power and willingness to fight, not guaranteed or inherent."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 92}, ""2"": {""content"": ""People ought to be prepared to use force\u2014even lethal\u2014to defend rights."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Opponents will eventually try to erode rights; conflict over rights is recurrent."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 75}, ""4"": {""content"": ""Maintaining rights depends more on conviction and resources than on abstract principles."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 78}}",2,directives,no,IMP,NAG

For two, I don't contest their freedom to speak their (very shitty, very bigoted) beliefs. It's when they start using intimidation and violence to enforce an ideology that we need to step up and take those matters into the hands of people who are willing and able to do something about it. The police (hopefully) will fulfill this role, but there is always a chance they won't. Then, we go to the state level of authority. Then federal. Then when all that fails, we need to be ready.
