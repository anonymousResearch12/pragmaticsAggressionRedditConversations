Residency,,m1bmm7,antibiolytics,"""post_title"": The Fellowship Question

""post_content"": I'm an IM PGY1 who's a non US IMG. What I thought I wanted as a fellowship has been shifting, with it my drive to apply in PGY3. I wanted to ask how profitable it is to work as a hospitalist (and waive my J1 requirements) in order to apply for fellowship? Is it looked favorably upon by fellowship PDs? Or are the traditions staying the same?

Would love the advice. For reference, I wanted heme/onc but now are flirting with pulm/crit. I just love the hospital too much right now.

Residency,2021-03-09 19:05:40,gqcses6,BrainOrCoronaries,"Can’t help regarding IM fellowships but thought it’s important to point out you’d have to work at least 3 years full time (40h/week) to get the J1 waiver (unless you can apply for a hardship waiver). 
That means you’d be applying at least 3 years after graduation, probably more since I’d recommend working where you got your waiver until you get your Green Card.",m1bmm7,"{""1"": {""content"": ""OP may be unaware of or underestimating the 3-year full-time requirement for a J1 waiver."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 76}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Pursuing a waiver first effectively postpones fellowship applications by several years."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 84}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Advises staying with the waiver employer until obtaining a green card to minimize immigration risk."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 72}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,NAG

Residency,2021-03-09 23:09:50,gqdos6k,Morzan73,"There isn’t a bias. It’s more paperwork, you have to hope their English is good. You have no clue as to the training of their medical school.

Residency,2021-03-09 23:21:30,gqdq9d0,BrainOrCoronaries,"These arguments are somewhat valid for residency but probably not for fellowship. English? They went through residency so it can’t be that bad. 
Training of Med school? Arguably, by the time you’re applying for fellowship people care about your pubs and where you finished residency and don’t give much importance, if at all, to your Med school. 
Hiring US citizen and taking their place. This is probably the strongest of your arguments in fellowship but it’s “only” 0.5 FTE funding (if at all) and by the time OP is applying for fellowship, they’ve been a “US taxpayer” for at least 3 years now so I’d argue they can get 0.5 FTE worth of benefits. As for taking a US citizen’s place, if OP is atractive enough to a program that they’d rather go through the hassle of visa and all than hire a US trainee, OP deserves the spot. The bar is usually higher (justifiably so).

Justified or not, there is clearly a bias against Visa-requiring applicants.",gqdos6k,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Claims that by fellowship, residency performance and publications outweigh medical school pedigree and English concerns."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 76}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Asserts there is a real bias against visa-requiring applicants, even if higher bars can be justified."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 82}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Argues visa applicants contribute taxes and thus merit access to limited training benefits."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 70}}",2,representatives,no,IMP,NAG
Residency,2021-03-10 00:39:46,gqdzsgq,Morzan73,"Nope, they’re still valid.
Residencies often take people based on scores alone. I interviewed with several candidates at academic programs that you could not understand at all.
Medical school absolutely matters. Your whole argument is there is a bias- part of that is bc international medical school curriculum cannot be verified (outside of Western Europe). There is no bias. Like you said, the bar is higher because it should be. Part of that includes medical school (if it didn’t matter they wouldn’t ask about it or require an mspe), speaking English well (many IMG’s hire PS and CV writers to make it seem like they speak and write well- this isn’t racism, France and Germany have even stricter language requirements), and, like it or not, they are not a us citizen, and thus are looking to take advantage of the high salary without going through our degree of debt. This is fine, but it the bar should be much higher for these individuals.",gqdq9d0,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Maintains that medical school pedigree and English proficiency remain critical and justify a higher bar for IMGs."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 82}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Denies bias while generalizing that many IMGs are hard to understand and rely on hired application writers."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 78}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Frames non-citizens as benefiting from US salaries without US debt, warranting even stricter standards."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 74}}",2,representatives,uncertain,IMP,CAG
