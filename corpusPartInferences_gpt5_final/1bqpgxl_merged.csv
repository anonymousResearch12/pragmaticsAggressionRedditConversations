Second of all, I said I would, not that I did.  

And obviously no hiring manager is ever going to disclose they didn't hire OP because he's 70.  They will all just find another reason to hire someone else.

Frankly there's no reason to discriminate on the basis of protected class anyway.  I can choose to not hire someone for any reason, or no reason.  I can choose to pass on a candidate because I don't like their haircut or their socks.
