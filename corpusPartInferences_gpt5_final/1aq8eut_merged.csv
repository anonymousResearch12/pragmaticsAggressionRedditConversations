""post_content"": r/itsthatbad is a new sub started for people to direct criticisms of dating culture through a passport bro lens. This is an alternative/adjacent sub.

thepassportbros,2024-02-14 07:09:49,kqcnn0n,cucumber_wolf,"A quick glance and it already looks like MGTOW 2.0. Yikes. I'm gonna guess 6 months, maybe a year tops, before it's quarantined and removed by Reddit.

I would be glad to see more success stories and discussions about international travel and dating on here, without having to sift through misogynistic rants every time I browse this sub. Yesterday's post (which was crossposted on several feminist websites btw) was particularly disgusting. I appreciate you guys taking that rubbish elsewhere.

But frankly I think that moving those women-bashing posts to a different sub is a temporary solution to the bigger picture issue of the attitude and mindset of some of the people on this forum.

thepassportbros,2024-02-14 14:05:32,kqdnyh5,cucumber_wolf,"I've been on this sub long enough that I think I know what I'm talking about.

There are two types of posts that show up on here. One is from guys who are genuinely travelling and dating abroad, who are sharing travel and dating stories or photos. Or maybe they are looking for advice on places to go or asking for dating advice or advice about their destinations. This is why I'm in this sub, because it's nice to see like minded people who are enjoying travelling and dating like me.

The second type of post is the bitter, negative post that has nothing to do with international travel and dating and is just a rant or vent about the western dating scene. If talking about western dating was all it was, I wouldn't mind because I get that we all need to vent sometimes. However, far too many of those posts are full of misogyny and negativity and bitterness. Some, like yesterday's post, are blatantly racist, too. That post disgusted me, and I think many of us were disgusted by that. There are screenshots of it on other subreddits now, and they are mocking this sub as we speak.

I suspect many of these posts are from men who have never actually been abroad, and they're just using this sub as a megaphone for their rants. Unfortunately those posts give this whole sub a bad name, and that is the reason that passport bros have a bad name all around the world.

I think the most ridiculous thing about those rants is that the posters don't accept criticism. They respond with pointless insults, like insulting the commenters mother. Like, really? That's very immature behavior. They aren't even willing to have a discussion. They just go straight into attack mode.

I really think those guys should take a step back and try to look at this sub (and now the new one) from an outside perspective and try to think about what it looks like from the outside. Does it give the impression that the men participating in it are quality men? Honestly, I don't think it does.

I also think that instead of responding to criticism with meaningless insults, maybe they should think for a minute about why the sub receives so much criticism and ask themselves if there might be some validity to the criticism. Sometimes listening to criticism, even when it's not what you want to hear, is an opportunity to learn and improve.

Moreover, I have been trying to say multiple times that being bitter and negative about women is not going to attract women anywhere in the world. I learned this the hard way. On my very first date abroad, in St Petersburg in 2018, the girl asked me why I went there and what was wrong with women in my home country. I told her exactly what I thought was wrong with women in my country. To no surprise, she was not impressed and I never heard from her again.

It should be obvious that a negative attitude towards an entire gender is not attractive to the gender towards which they are being negative, but I often get downvoted or refuted when I try to say this.

Here's a question worth thinking about. If you were getting serious with a woman and she came across that subreddit, do you think she would be impressed or disgusted by what she saw? I would guess probably the latter, and that is why I think many of those guys need to re-evaluate their thinking and work on themselves before thinking about travelling abroad to look for a partner. Or better yet, do what I did and make the travels into a self improvement project. I've done a lot of self reflection on my trips and it was great. I believe that my self improvement is why I finally found my wife on one of my trips.

I wish all the men on here the best, I really do. I hope you find what you're looking for. And if all you need is a place to vent, I understand that. I appreciate your effort in setting up a new sub to keep those vents separate from here. I will not be participating in that sub. I do not wish to immerse myself into that kind of negativity. I'll let you guys have your space over there. But my two cents is you should try to re-evaluate whether a vent sub is the best solution, or if the better option is moving on and finding enjoyment and peace in international travel and dating.

It's a tough world we live in, and I understand dating in the west is frustrating sometimes. I really do get that.

**This is the problem.** **No one is allowed to discuss systemic problems in dating and relationships in certain cultures without being labeled incorrectly and unfairly. We're trying to change that positively.**

That's why I've started the sub with voices from other sources, including voices of women. That's why I'm encouraging people to bring in academic papers, studies about these problems.

thepassportbros,2024-02-14 15:05:37,kqdvx79,cucumber_wolf,"Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but it seems to me that a lot of guys are stuck on this whole #itsthatbad thing. I mean, I get it, and I agree with you that it's true. I saw how bad the dating scene in America was 6 years ago, but instead of stewing on it, I got up and did something about it. I got on a plane and started travelling, decided to work on self improvement at the same time, and I travelled to several countries in search of love, which I wasn't finding back home. It didn't take me that long, and it wasn't complicated. I didn't need to spend that much time on Reddit or YouTube to figure this out.

So don't you think you guys are kicking a dead horse at this point?

If the subreddit can keep to what you mention in this comment above, then I think it's fair. However, what's to stop it from evolving into a negative place (I'll avoid labelling here), that is going to see the same fate as other subs of this nature? MGTOW was also a good idea on the surface: men checking out of the dating scene and pursuing other endeavors in life such as careers, hobbies, or self sufficient lifestyles. But look where that sub went over the years.

Will you have strict moderation against these women-bashing posts? (I'm sure you are aware of the type of posts I'm talking about. Do you have a better description fir those posts?) If a guy posts a statement like ""all \_\_\_ are \_\_\_"" or like yesterday's post of ""white women are the worst"", will you ban them? I hope you understand why I am both angry and horrified by that post yesterday, especially the fact that it went viral on Reddit and paints all men who are travelling in search of love in bad light.",kqds1do,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Recommends action and self-improvement (travel) over prolonged grievance discourse about dating culture."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 83}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Warns of drift into hostility like MGTOW and calls for strict moderation and bans on blanket women-bashing."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 86}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Expresses anger and reputational concern about viral misogynistic content associated with the community."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 80}}",2,directives,uncertain,IMP,NAG

thepassportbros,2024-02-14 18:15:20,kqeqtyi,cucumber_wolf,"Thanks for the discussion. I appreciate it. I wish we could have more of these types of discussions, because I actually enjoy listening to viewpoints of others, even those I disagree with. Unfortunately most people these days don't do that, they just wanna insult and cancel opposing opinions. 

I agree that the dating culture in the west has gone downhill, especially the past decade. As someone who is mildly autistic, dating in America has been next to impossible. I can hold a job, have a degree, etc. But being shy when approaching women and being seen as slightly ""weird"" basically disqualifies me from the American dating pool. The only women I've attracted in the states are crazies or ones that want to take advantage of me. It sucks, and maybe that's why I realized pretty quickly that going abroad was the right choice for me.  And once I went abroad 6 years ago, I never even bothered with trying to date back home. Every time I would hop on Tinder back home I was like, what's the point, why even bother trying? So I hear and understand the other guys who say they have a hard time. And I have no issue with men expressing frustrations about dating. What I have an issue with is that there is some very obvious misogyny that gets posted here. That is what I think it unwelcome here, as it should be. I see that your sub also says no misogyny as one of the rules, so I think you get it, too. 

I'm not afraid to call out BS on this sub when I see it. But I do appreciate a civil and good conversation like this. I wish there could be more discussions like this instead of people getting offended all the time and throwing (usually very inaccurate) insults at ppbs and men with foreign wives, or conversely throwing insults when they receive any form of criticism.",kqdymzn,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Asserts Western dating has worsened and that travel can be a functional alternative, informed by neurodivergent experience."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 82}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Supports venting but rejects misogyny, endorsing rules against it across subs."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 85}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Advocates for civil discourse and opposes insult-driven exchanges and cancel-style tactics."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 80}}",2,representatives,uncertain,IMP,NAG

thepassportbros,2024-02-15 09:26:02,kqiboua,cucumber_wolf,"Why do men in this forum get so up on end at the word ""misogyny""? And why do they deny so hard that it exists on this forum? I'm not saying all PPBs are misogynistic. That's not true at all. There are lots of good men here who have given up on the American/western dating pool to look for love abroad. And there's nothing wrong with that.

But misogyny exists on here and I'm not afraid to call it out when I see it. I will call a spade a spade. The post the other day titled ""white women are the fucking worst"" was outright misogyny, plain and simple. There is no other word to describe that post. It was crossposted across several other subs and also screenshotted and shared outside of Reddit. The world all agreed that was blatant misogyny.

It exists at a more subtle level, too. Right now there is a thread going on about dating women over 40. Overall I think it's a reasonable and fair discussion. But c'mon, calling 40 year old singles leftovers and damaged goods like they're produce at a supermarket...really? A couple comments say that all older women have mental illness. One commenter is calling men who date older women simps and beta (but won't explain why). Another is saying you should rent before you buy when talking about dating women, as if they are a piece of property (I think there are better ways that could have been said).

I think some of the guys on here need to take a step back and think about what the things that are said on here sound like from the outside. I also think some guys here need to learn how to accept criticism without lashing out with insults. I don't mind a civil discussion on here, but I fail to understand why people think they're getting by making lewd statements about my mother when I disagree with them.

If me stating that I think we should show a little more respect for women and stop with the posts hating on women, on a sub that's about searching for women, makes me a ""woke social justice warrior"" then fine. I wouldn't call myself that, I just believe in a little bit of respect and compassion, but if you want to call me that, I'm not offended.

We all know that there are a minority of men who take it too far and insult women for no good reason, do you think the majority of us agree? Of course not.

Personally, I’d never tell a random 40 year old single woman that she’s a leftover or whatever unless she outright attacks me and I’m willing to bet that most PPB think the same way.
