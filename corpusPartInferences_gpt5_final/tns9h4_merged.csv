Learn to appreciate advice when asking for it and go educate yourself on ways to get better instead of lashing out at a stranger who took the time to answer a question you asked.

Thank you for confirming exactly what I already knew. I'm a worthless twat and should just disappear.

I've experimented so fucking much, nothing fucking works.

confessions,2022-03-30 20:13:42,i2qturm,Brief_Hour_4690,"You had mentioned already going to a therapist, but maybe try going to a new one to hear a different perspective? I don't think he was calling you a useless asshole, just that you need to try viewing life from a more positive perspective. No one has the same route to happiness, it takes lots of experimentation. Even then, it is impossible to always be happy as thats just part of life. 

Reddit is a support system to give you motivation, but happiness will ultimately come from trying to adopt a positive mindset and experimenting in life with hobbies and tasks that make you happy. I know you said you already experimented, but ask yourself what experimenting means. Look for things that make you happy, and do so from a positive mindset. Talk to your therapist about antidepressants as well perhaps- no shame in it at all. 

When you think about yourself, you need to give yourself value. Calling yourself worthless will only spread inner negativity. Stop worrying about what others say or think. 

Reach out and send a message if you'd like to talk. Outside of reddit, begin giving yourself value and dont worry about what others think. Life is a constant journey, and everyone is different, so don't compare yourself to others. There are ups and downs moments, but its all about moving forward, even when you may not want to.

Even my own mother disagrees with that one. My life is a comedy of tragedies and I don't even wanna bother listing them. Responding even feels too much like attention seeking.

I feel like I keep faking it alright, but I honestly still call myself a dumbfuck even in my happier moments.

I'd be less afraid of mistakes if I didn't make so fucking many of them. The only things I'm useful for is dishes, heat wrapping, and box making, and as evidenced above, I sometimes can't even get that right.

I want to be positive and I try as hard as I can, it just feels impossible when all my life has taught me is that the things that make me happy will either be taken from me or mocked relentlessly by even my own family.
