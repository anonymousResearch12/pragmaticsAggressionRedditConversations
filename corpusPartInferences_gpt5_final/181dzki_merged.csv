NoFapChristians,2023-11-24 00:09:55,kahz8ni,International-Car937,"Your statement regarding freewill is absolutely ridiculous!

Can the will act without motives, or contrary to motives?  If it could, it would be irrational.  To think so is to be completely prejudiced.  If the will acts according to its enslaved nature and is influenced by outside situations and previous experiences, no honest thinking person can call it free.  Motives do not cause or determine but only influence the will.  The will causes and determines but is always under the influences of motives.  A person cannot act contrary to his character or influences.  There is no such thing therefore as a free will that can make a choice contrary to what is already determined.  While it is true that the will acts in accordance with its own influences and character so that it acts freely within its own nature and personality, this in no way makes it free to act contrary to its own character and influences.
 
“Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?  Then ye may also do good that are taught to do evil.”                                                                                          Jeremiah 13:23
 “The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked.”                                         Jeremiah 17:9
 How can a wicked heart act righteously?  It has the same possibility as a rotten egg changing itself into a good one and without any outside help.  Therefore there is no such thing as freedom such as the free-willers claim.  Heredity and environment and the character of the will produced by previous experiences determines the direction of all future acts.",kahujnq,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Argues there is no genuine free will; choices follow nature and motives."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 88}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Openly insults the interlocutor\u2019s freewill claim as 'ridiculous'."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Appeals to human depravity texts to ground determinism."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 78}}",1,representatives,uncertain,IMP,OAG

For everything that you’re saying— I want you to provide solid Biblical texts, verses, chapters, doctrines, examples etc I.e 1.) God causes sin 2.) God wants sin here 3.)God is NOT against sin 4.) God does NOT punish sin 5.) Explain with BIBLICAL texts that You have an understanding of God’s eternal purpose. 

Once you do these, I’ll continue my arguments with solid biblical references and will answer the question that you are dodging and/or not giving a solid, correct answer to (How can we please God) - Cause I know

Ref verses

“We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies” (1 Corinthians 8:1).

“So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing” (1 Thessalonians 5:11).

Proverbs 18:21 KJV - Death and life are in the power of the tongue: And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

James 3:8-10 but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
9
With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.
