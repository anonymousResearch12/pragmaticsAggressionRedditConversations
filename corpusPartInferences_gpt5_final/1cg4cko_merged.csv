I saw my job posted up on Indeed, I've had some medical issues as of late to cause me to come in late or take a couple days off. However, I've always made up my time and even have several documentations from my doctor that HR has.

They don't take into consideration we have things outside of our job, theres a point system to where if you're even on time, you're late.

Only a few can work from home and I requested that after having surgery and they denied me, thus deduction in my pay.
Everything has been documented, and obviously the ""chats"" I have with my boss or HR have all been recorded.

However, the last conversation I had with my boss and HR, my boss acted like I didn't even call or text her I was going to be late that day. I had to show HR proof off of my phone.

careerguidance,2024-05-01 02:12:41,l20rkvn,Snoo_38398,"So I wanted to ask for advice again. Today, things were off... I just pick up on things. One of the people who do the second rounds of interviewing for manufacturing management jobs was called into my bosses office. She just came up to him and asked her to go to her office which is within eye distance for me. They closed the door. Now she never closes the door unless it's something that shouldn't be heard.
Then I felt like I got tested today, I had multiple people come up to me with questions I've never even conversed with before.
Then a girl no one knew in my department (I'm a buyer/purchasing) was escorted to my bosses office and once again the door got shut. I tried to listen through the walls while my other coworkers were trying to listen through other means (I know) but ultimately couldn't hear anything because it was the perfect time for the girl across my bosses office to shred things.
So initially, if you get a second interview it's three main people, and one happens to be my best friend but she's the one who trains everyone...but it would be a conflict because they would know she would tell me or give me a heads up.
So when I left for work today, I made an excuse at the receptionist asking her if one of my vendors had came here because I was ""waiting"" for him, but this allowed me to see the sign in sheet...and yes multiple people for interviews. Again, no one in my buying department has been told there is an open position.
