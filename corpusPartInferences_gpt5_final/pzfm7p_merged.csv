AusLegal,,pzfm7p,VJ4rawr2,"""post_title"": When does a contract end and a new contract begins?

""post_content"": Here is the scenario. 

Tim runs a landscaping business and Kate pays him $1000 to build a patio. 

Tim is unable to perform the task. He offers Kate a partial refund or $1000 credit towards a future project. 

Kate accepts the credit. 

Is that contract now complete?

If Kate then hires Tim to paint the house and uses that credit to pay him, is that considered a new contract?

AusLegal,2021-10-02 04:33:14,hf1v46o,VJ4rawr2,"Thanks. What are some of the variables that might be relevant ?

From my understanding a contract involves offer, consideration and acceptance. 

In the above example, if the consumer had accepted a partial refund (as cash) in lieu of the contract being fulfilled, the acceptance of compensation (cash) would have ended the contract. 

If they used that cash to pay to have their house painted, that would then be a new contract (offer, consideration and acceptance). 

I’m just interested to know whether credit is treated differently to cash when accepting a refund.

That would also end the contract.

It’s not dependent on the consumer using credit.

I was just curious how the issuance of credit was treated in general principal in relation to rescission of a contract. 

Essentially my issue is I signed a contract pre covid, the other party failed to deliver on the contract, they issued credit as a refund.  I then used that credit to purchase a new product and they’re trying to retroactively apply the terms and conditions of contract 1, despite them having a different set of terms and conditions at time I paid (using credit) for the second product.
