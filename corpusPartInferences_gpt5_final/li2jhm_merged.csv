AusLegal,,li2jhm,MoveToAlternate,"""post_title"": Requirements to use text messages in court?

""post_content"": I would like to use text messages and also messages sent over fb messenger as evidence in court and during mediation. 

I have seen a Justice of the Peace signing print outs of text messages before. Is that required? Do I keep the persons name as contact, as displayed at the top on iPhone or do I have just their phone number?

AusLegal,2021-02-12 06:02:47,gn0zop7,GL1001,"If its child custody then im guessing its the Federal Circuit Court or Family Court.

Any material relied upon in court needs to be annexed to an affidavit which would then be witnessed by a JP or lawyer.

Name or number at the top wont make a difference since you're asserting that the otherside sent it and that issue will only need to be ventilated if the otherside denies sending it.

Dont take a screenshot to mediation or court and expect it to carry any weight. It's only useful once it has been annexed to an affidavit and provided to the otherside to allow them to respond to any assertion that you are making.",li2jhm,"{""1"": {""content"": ""For court weight, electronic messages should be annexed to an affidavit and witnessed by a JP/lawyer."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Whether the header shows a name or a number is immaterial unless authorship is contested."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 88}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Unannexed screenshots have little evidentiary value and should be disclosed properly to the other side."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""4"": {""content"": ""The dispute likely falls within Family Court/Federal Circuit Court procedures."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 75}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

Wtf...

He's asking how to rely on material at Court and you're suggesting he needs to print it out and bring it along with the person who wrote it or received it?

You're fucked lol.

 Both answers have helped me out a great deal. 

I haven’t had legal council for a while and I’m getting swamped and out of my depth. I have booked to see a new lawyer who I will likely stay with for the remainder of proceedings. I wanted to have as much ready when I have my appointment to best utilise our time efficiently. 

Currently in mediation but it’s not going very well so I may seek advice if I should go to trial. 

For my appointment I will take in hard copies of the messages I would like used and if the lawyer advises to use them then I know I can then move to the JP and appendix thereafter.
