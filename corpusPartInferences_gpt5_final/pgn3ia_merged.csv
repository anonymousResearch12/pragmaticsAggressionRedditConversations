""post_content"": In Sweden they think you are on heroin if you smoke weed, even the hipsters. It is the worst EU country for marijuana.

weed,2021-09-02 21:15:51,hbcpqfb,[deleted],"Yes thats correct. If cops in sweden suspect you are high they have the right to take your freedom away by putting you in a cell until you “sober up” 

I’ve had to sleep in cold cells multiple times because I’m a known cannabis user, i use it for medicinal reasons. technically medicinal use of cannabis is legal in sweden if it’s prescribed by a doctor, very difficult to get it prescribed even tho now it’s easier than ever to get it legally here. It’s been an expensive nightmare to get it legally in my experience. And ive also been denied all types of treatments at medical centers since im a known cannabis user. But cops do not give a shit and happily violate you and lock you up for it.

Edit: it does not matter what substance you are under the influence of, by law you are not allowed to be high/medicated or even drunk.

I cant even buy normal cbd oil from another EU country without risking prosecution for international drug smuggling or something crazy like that. They recently classified CBD as a narcotic to battle the importation of it.

My point was the finnish people demanded it and the government listened. We to not have the option in sweden to tell the government anything no matter how many sign a petition for change.

Find a reasonable doctor (which i bet is hard when it comes to cannabis) and you will get it prescribed. Pretty much the same here.

As long as the cbd oil adheres to EU law and made by EU approved cannabis hemp varieties it is legal.
