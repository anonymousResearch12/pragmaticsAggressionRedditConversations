""post_content"": Hello, my name is Lori. I and my husband are in a relationship where we did put our child up for adoption. It’s an open adoption and we are very grateful that we picked an amazing couple to raise our child. I am hoping that when my son does find out the truth that he will be open and understanding and receptive to wanting to meet us. My fear is that he won’t be that way. He is going to be four years old in February, it’s just an uncertainty that I have in fear that I have and a guilt that I have.",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The child has not yet been told about the adoption; disclosure is being deferred until he is 'old enough.'"", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The speaker seeks emotional validation and fears future rejection despite believing she chose a good adoptive couple."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""3"": {""content"": ""She trusts the adoptive couple and frames relinquishment as child-centered while carrying guilt and uncertainty."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 75}}",1,representatives,uncertain,PRE,NAG
Adoption,2024-11-03 04:23:17,lv4jd45,Sage-Crown,"He doesn’t know he’s adoptive? What does the “open adoption” look like? 

I understand your fear, but that’s a risk you have to take when you’re placing a child for adoption. I’m also a bio mom and my biggest fear is that he doesn’t have a good childhood and has a lot of difficulty in life due to being adopted. I’ve accepted that I don’t matter in this situation.

Adoption,2024-11-03 04:27:16,lv4jx4j,glasgowlorelie,"No, he is three years old and he does not know that he is adopted. His adopted parents they allowed my husband and I to put together of my family, my husband‘s family siblings, etc. etc. I also letters that we had written ultrasound pictures. We have a Facebook where we keep in touch with each other that way sending photos during holidays, birthdays or just how is it going kind of days When I say it’s an open adoption. A lot of people are very surprised how open it is even though we did choose them out of all these other couples that we were looking at, they wouldn’t allow us to proceed with the adoption unless we made it an open adoption because we had originally wanted it to be closed, but we both really like this couple and we knew that these people are the ones that we felt would be amazing in raising our son. They were at the hospital. This was during Covid so only one person could be in the hospital room with me and that was my husband, but they were in another room while I was having the baby and they even gave our son my husband‘s middle name it’s an amazing couple. I would not trade it for anything. I knew that my husband and I were not gonna be able to take care of him I was lost and broken from the passing of my mother and my grandfather, and we had just lost the baby a year before we had Levi. Levi is my son‘s name. I was just recovering from drugs and alcohol and I was just financially not able to take care of him. It was a surprise pregnancy. 45 years old and pregnant.",1gidux9,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Originally preferred a closed adoption but accepted open terms to secure this specific couple."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Equates 'openness' with exchanging artifacts and adult-to-adult contact rather than ensuring the child\u2019s own understanding."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Offers a justification narrative (bereavement, recovery, finances, age) to seek moral absolution for relinquishment."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 85}, ""4"": {""content"": ""Shows deference to adopters\u2019 requirements, indicating a power imbalance in setting openness terms."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 70}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,NAG
