its not a ban at all, its firstly just a different media ecosystem and secondly a contract thing. artists or their publishing company will sign different contracts with different outlets, so when foreigners sign for netease its usually just the rights for china. if youre outside of china and using netease it wont be availble because they already have a contract with western apps for those regions. 

>hurting the goodness of a beautiful culture with that attitude

telling people to avoid the bing chilling and social credit shit is actually standong up for and defending them from western chauvinism.

also, im not mad. i get that youre young and that shit is normal on the western internet. i do the same thing over here for chinese people when there copying american edgy jokes or think saying the nword is funny. they dont have the context to know that shit is corny and offensive. i dont want them saying the wrong thing to the wrong person and getting in trouble",lmym601,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Clarifies they are not Chinese but live in China and are trying to prevent the other from embarrassment."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.88}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Refutes the \u2018ban\u2019 narrative, explaining regional unavailability via media ecosystems and licensing contracts."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Advises avoiding \u2018bing chilling/social credit\u2019 jokes as western chauvinism."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.86}, ""4"": {""content"": ""Uses an empathetic, mentoring tone, attributing missteps to youth/internet culture."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.78}}",2,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
