TrueUnpopularOpinion,,1696spx,AbyssWankerArtorias,"""post_title"": The only rights you have are the ones you're willing to fight and die for.

""post_content"": Many rights we take for granted are ones we only have because the people that survived the conflict believed in them and passed down those values. Freedom of speech is only a right in western countries because the people that fought for it passed down that value. 

Your rights aren't something you'll have no matter what and eventually, someone may try to take them from you. The only thing that will decide if you maintain that right is who has the stronger conviction and more resources to act on that conviction.",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Rights are not inherent or guaranteed; they must be actively defended, sometimes through conflict."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.98}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Societal values and rights are preserved only if people are willing to make sacrifices for them."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""3"": {""content"": ""There is an implicit warning that rights can be lost if people become complacent."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

TrueUnpopularOpinion,2023-09-04 00:11:36,jz0eu78,AbyssWankerArtorias,"Well. I live very far from Florida for one. For two, I don't contest their freedom to speak their (very shitty, very bigoted) beliefs. It's when they start using intimidation and violence to enforce an ideology that we need to step up and take those matters into the hands of people who are willing and able to do something about it. The police (hopefully) will fulfill this role, but there is always a chance they won't. Then, we go to the state level of authority. Then federal. Then when all that fails, we need to be ready.

The point is to not be reactionary, but to always be prepared.",jz0cis2,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The speaker distinguishes between supporting free speech and opposing violent enforcement of ideology."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.97}, ""2"": {""content"": ""There is a belief in escalating responses: from police to state to federal, and finally to personal action if institutions fail."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Preparedness is valued over reactionary behavior."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
