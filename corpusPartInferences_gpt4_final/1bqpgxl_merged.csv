Second of all, I said I would, not that I did.  

And obviously no hiring manager is ever going to disclose they didn't hire OP because he's 70.  They will all just find another reason to hire someone else.

Frankly there's no reason to discriminate on the basis of protected class anyway.  I can choose to not hire someone for any reason, or no reason.  I can choose to pass on a candidate because I don't like their haircut or their socks.  

I have 100% refused to interview someone because of their hair.  Guy took a pic of himself sitting in a hair salon chair, wearing the cape, with freshly dyed blue hair.
