""post_content"": I can’t make friends when I can’t be myself I just feel so angry and alone all the time I just wish I was someone socially acceptable so I could truly admit my likes and interests and personality and meet likeminded people and not have to worry that I’m making them live in fear of the implications of being around someone like me

I have pervasive thoughts to be hurt badly and cause the same and never be alone. No escaping due to high amounts of pain. I don’t hurt people, it’s a mental obsession.

Of course, it‘s not something most people are extremely open about, but I feel like I’d pick up on these things better than most. I never endured significant trauma before I remember these fantasies really taking off. I don’t know what brought on these thoughts, really. I had sadistic fantasies that were sexually motivated since before I knew what sex or kinks were at all. That said, I know sadomasochism isn’t horrifically uncommon. I have heard very brief stories that my uncle was perverted and had many sexual partners, but ehhh that was from my father who thinks masochists are a horrifically disturbing concept. On top of that I have an obsessive personality, and attachment issues. I think it’s the combination that makes me feel at odds with everyone else, really, because I’m often worried about losing the person I love and therefore my mind often obsesses over them and the idea of them up, etc.",jp4dm8i,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author denies trauma or family history as causes, suggesting their obsessions are intrinsic and long-standing."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.96}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author presupposes that sadomasochistic fantasies are not uncommon, but their own obsessive personality and attachment issues make their experience more isolating."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}}",1,representatives,yes,PRE,NAG
