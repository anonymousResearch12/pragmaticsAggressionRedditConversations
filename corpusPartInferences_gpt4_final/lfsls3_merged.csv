NoFap,2021-02-09 04:12:09,gmnoyqo,GambinosDisciple,"In my experience of no fap, the only way it's worth it is if you're devotedly working on something (eg: gym, school, sports, self-improvement). If you don't have any real ambitions in life atm, and you just want to do nofap for the sake of it, you'll find yourself more stressed than relieved or productive. However, if you have big plans and are challenging yourself daily, your motivation, performance, and focus will absolutely rocket. Again, I'm talking from personal experience, but many people agree with this, hopefully you can make something out of my testament.",lfsls3,"{""1"": {""content"": ""No fap is only beneficial if it is part of a broader self-improvement or goal-oriented effort."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Attempting no fap without a larger purpose may lead to increased stress rather than productivity."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author values ambition and self-improvement as important life goals."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.88}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
