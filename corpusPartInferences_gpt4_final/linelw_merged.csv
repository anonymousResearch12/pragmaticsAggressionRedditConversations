I have found that educating myself about how PTSD works and how it affects the body and brain has been really beneficial to me. It has NOTHING to do with forgiveness. You can forgive, but your body actually remembers trauma and your brain is literally rewired after experiencing it. I highly recommend reading the book, The Body Keeps the Score. It's really fascinating and educational. The body really does 'keep the score', which is our body's response to triggers after trauma (fight, flight, or freeze).

Another thing to look up is EMDR therapy.

Having PTSD has nothing to do with forgiveness. It also has nothing to do with blaming, nor wanting the way of the world. It's your body's response to trauma, a response that you normally have little control over. Of course we should lean on God, but it doesn't mean He chooses to heal all of us or even in the same way or within the same time frame.
