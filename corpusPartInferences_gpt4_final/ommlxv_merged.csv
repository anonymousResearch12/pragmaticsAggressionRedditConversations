There is no database, they scan your card to make sure it's a real dl and you are legal age. It's faster and basically insurance. I have several friends who work in government jobs who buy from us instead of getting a med card.

I have also worked for casinos that have they same rule as you are dealing with now, any injuries required a blood draw for insurance. I loved the job so I didn't smoke while I worked there.
