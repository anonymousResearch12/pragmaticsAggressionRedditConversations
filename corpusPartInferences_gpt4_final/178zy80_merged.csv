Next time you take a hot shower, just think how the heat is just because the ATOMS have more ENERGY and are moving faster.

NoFap,2023-10-16 10:11:40,k538z2k,Thin-Air-4929,Thanks for the comment üòä. How this is helpful for me is because I can see at the base of things what exactly I‚Äôm watching and makes it seem like a more achievable goal. And yes I constantly think about what everything is and how it works so it may sound a bit weird to you but I think someone out there might find it helpful.,k538igm,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author finds personal value in the pixel-reduction strategy, even if it seems odd to others."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.91}, ""2"": {""content"": ""There is an implicit belief that unconventional methods may help some people, even if not universally accepted."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.88}}",1,expressives,no,IMP,NAG

It's good to see things from a different perspective but you're still in neutral territory.
