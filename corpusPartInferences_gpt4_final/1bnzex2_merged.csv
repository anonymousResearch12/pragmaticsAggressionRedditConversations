Buddhism,,1bnzex2,Lonelygayinillinois,"""post_title"": Vision Half a Year Ago-Does anyone know what this was?

""post_content"": Around half a year ago, while contemplating rebirth, I had an intense vision. In this vision, I saw fleas, mice and a dog and thought ""this is me"". I realized everything was pushed into form through causation. I also saw bright lights throughout the vision. I felt like I had seen my connectedness to everything.

Who taught you this contemplation? (How to do it)

Do you have a teacher?

During process of cultivation myriad phenomena can arise hence it's advisable to practice under a qualified teacher with attainments in the practices your interested in...

Having a good teacher could save you from wasting months/years on wrong views/practices or simply not knowing how to proceed to the next ...

Trying to figure it out on your own invariably involves exploring numerous dead ends & potentially dangerous paths..


Best wishes & safe journey

Great üëèüèª 

So what's your Teacher/Guru's perspective on the matter? 

Did you not like his/her answer ? ü§£ (excuse my playfulness)

Or are you seeking a second opinion to verify your Guru's/Teachers opinion?

Or have you not asked you teacher yet?


It's certainly an interesting experience , the answer you get might depend on the goals of the tradition you follow...

Same with the answers you'll get here..

Some may go into analysis of the vision & its symbolic meaning 

Some may advise to ignore it & continue with the original practice that let to the vision (staying focused on your objective).


All depends üôèüèª

Great sign of encouragement regardless so keep up with your practice but remember that its very important not to become overly attached to any phenomena that arises or secretly wish in ones heart that the phenomena will repeat.

Best wishes

Buddhism,2024-03-26 23:19:24,kwpmwav,Playful-Independent4,"""I had a vision"". You have your answer. Your imagination summoned feelings and images. What it was is nothing more than what you described it as. 

Plus, the ""this is me"" part seems a little off in terms of buddhist teachings. 

Does that answer your question? A vision is a vision, like a dream is a dream, a thought is a thought, a feeling is a feeling, and so on. Our senses and imaginations bombard us with information all the time. There is no special meaning behind it. There is only the meaning you decide to give it. It's entirely internal (as much as we can distinguish internal and external causes). You read about interconnectedness, and eventually you imagined that you were dogs and mice.

There are many ways to consider non-materialist perspectives philosophically. Just because you haven't observed non-matter (to your knowledge) doesn't mean that non-matter doesn't exist.   


And there are absolutely ways of considering it a problem outside of ""We have no clear/complete model"", even if we had a clear/complete model it would still be a problem because our perceptions and intellect are not infallible.   


  
I recommend ""Invitation to Physics"" by Ken Greider and ""Metaphysics"" by W.H Walsh so you can become better informed.

I guess there is value in ignoring my point, since it has a high risk of becoming a debate of semantics, but still. I really can't engage with this approach. You've ignored everything I said just so you can feel comfortable with believing in reality-breaking stuff and avoid having to phrase your initial question less ambiguously.

You are arrogant, and you do not have even a basic understanding of physics or philosophy. Before you accuse someone of making ""reality-breaking claims"", you should at least get a basic understanding of how you interact with reality and what you can really claim about reality. Please read ""Metaphysics"" by W.H Walsh. I swear to God, I will buy it for you if you promise you will read it. It's a really great book that goes over many great philosophers and their views on reality and what we can and can't claim in those philosophers' perspectives.
