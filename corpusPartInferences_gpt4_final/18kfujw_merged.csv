""post_content"": Rich white boys killing themselves with drugs lol. You don't see blacks doing that shit. We too busy with jobs and going to school and working this country. Only whites throw their lives away. They should give all of Matthew Perry's money to the true heroes of America- single black moms who raising the next generation of America. It's bullshit that any black single mom going hungry when you got rich white bitches like Matthew Perry spending a million dollars on drugs.

All types of people and races struggle. Matthew Perry earned his money due to the revenue generated from a prominent role in a heavily popularized sitcom. How is this a confession? Itâ€™s just object racism without any real attempt to create a fully formed thought. There are single moms and dads everywhere that are struggling from economic hardship. To act like a celebrityâ€™s death has anything to do with that is outrageous and a juvenile and idiotic attempt at sounding intelligent.,kdqsz5t,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author rejects the racial generalizations and sees the original post as lacking intellectual merit and being overtly racist."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.97}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author presupposes that economic hardship affects people of all races, not just Black single mothers."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.94}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,CAG
