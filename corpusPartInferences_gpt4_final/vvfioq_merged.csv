Think of it much like how you work out. Staying in the same place, doing the same set of push-ups every day is a comfortable place to be. But comfort is never the way to make yourself better. You need to test yourself, to see what you KNOW you can't get over. We can take every day of our lives worrying about what *could* happen, instead of taking that worry-time to actually try it. I believe in you, despite what your brain tells you. Despite how few people you might have on your side. If you know you need help, that tells me you have at least a little will to be better than you are now.
