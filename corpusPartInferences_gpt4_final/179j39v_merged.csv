“Why is Israel not opening a Humanitarian corridor for the people of Gaza to try and help them? 

Hamas would certainly attack any assistance efforts.  The bombed the field hospital Israel set up for Gazans.

“Many international experts condemned Israel”

And what else is new?

“Why does Israeli law only reconise Jewish pre-1948/ pre-6 days war claims to properties in Sheikh Jarrah/ East Jerusalem, but rejects Arab claims?”

Probably has something to do with Arabs being their sworn enemies.  

“do Israelis sees the images of dead palestinians, child dead palestinians, and the monts of corpses arriving at Al-Aqsa hospital?”

Probably, but I’m guessing their minds are still focused on their own dead children purposely murdered.

“Certainly they would want to know what is happening at Gaza, right?”

2) A humanitarian corridor needs a destination. Such as the Sinai Peninsula, which Egypt controls.

3) There was a population exchange in 1948. After the exchange, the properties in East Jerusalem owned by Jewish families  were occupied by Arab families, who were given protected tenant status by Jordan. Jordan did not transfer ownership to the Arab families, so they still have Jewish owners. If/when the Arab families no longer qualify for protected tenant status, the owners can do with the property as they are fit. Including choosing new tenants.
