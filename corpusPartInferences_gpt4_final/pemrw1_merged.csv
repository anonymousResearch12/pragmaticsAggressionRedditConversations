There’s a conspiracy in there somewhere but, as most of us know, the secret cabal of faceless, anonymous, chickenshit mods wield great power and control.

confessions,2021-08-31 15:46:50,hb21rm7,rmike7842,"So then how do these 4 moderators control their minions?  For them to have such power, they would have to have either almost robotic control or perhaps some type of almost religious following amongst the lesser moderators who would rely on some type of dogma to know what to look for and how to respond.  Is that even possible?  Also, why the Chinese and not the New World Order (NWO).  It strikes me that the NWO would have more interest in what you describe as “sensitive pussies”.  The Chinese strike me as old fashioned military and money interests.
