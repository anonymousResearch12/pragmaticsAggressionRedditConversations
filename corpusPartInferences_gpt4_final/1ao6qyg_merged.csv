IndiaSpeaks,2/11/2024 13:44,kpx6xnh,avinchavhan,"You are a victim of subversion tactics used by neomarxism that defines the world view in to oppressors and oppressed, yes, you have to think about how much mainstream content you’ve come across with that premise with an open mind. Reality is the real world you see with your eyes and experience with people, can you really say that minorities are treated like second class citizens in India?

This is not just in India, it’s happening across the world with active funding from China, and is no conspiracy theory as media outlets themselves declared how much funding the get from Communists and Dictatorships, including universities as well, where death chants like “from river to the sea” are openly used by Harvard students.

I have made an entire post on why “Hindu Nationalism” is a wrong term for “Dharmic Revivalism”, and this mindset of fake oppression is used to create divide which isn’t good for any aspect of it can lead to civil wars as explained by **Robert Spencer’s 2023 book “The Sumter Gambit: How the Left Is Trying to Foment a Civil War”.**

Additionally you can go through this lecture by ex-KGB agent to learn how subversion is used first hand. All in all if you ever come across such oppressors vs oppressed narratives reject it outright because it is a false narrative used to create a divide and ruin society, for it to be true it has to have 200% certainty with no room for doubt since you now know the alternative is being falsely propagated.",1ao6qyg,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author believes that narratives of minority oppression are manufactured by external ideological influences (e.g., neomarxism, foreign funding)."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""There is a presupposition that minorities are not actually treated as second-class citizens in India."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author is dismissive of claims of oppression, viewing them as divisive and potentially dangerous."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,CAG

If you are talking about religion per se, reddit consists of a very polar opposite spectrum of people. You will either get the best or the worst. In reality it is different (though problems do exist even).

The minority plays the victim card - most of the time. Be it religion, caste, special status etc. Take for example the demolition of religious places in Mehrauli, New Delhi. One mosque, 2 Shiva temples, 1 Kali temple and 1 Hanuman temple were razed by the DDA after discussing the matter with the respective religious committees (including Muslims) since 2020. They served notice and went on with the demolition drive. Nobody raised an objection. The mosque was an old one but ASI didn't mind it. Can you guess who is crying about it? The minority. They are crying and asking as if they wanted the notice to be served to each and every person of the faith (stupid). Also, the mosque had extended the construction beyond what the ASI had marked in 1922.

The land was bought by DDA from private owners years ago. So, the rule is you can do whatever you want to do with your land. To begin with, do not live on land you don't own (not talking about the orphaned kids who lived there) but the owners who decided that it was their own. Can you just start construction of a house anywhere you want? Now, the entire community is speaking ill, bringing in religion and the propaganda machine has started. BBC has done a piece, the left media is calling the BJP (though it happened in Delhi by DDA).

You can see how this resentment arises among the majority and it becomes very easy for the minority to feel the pain. Also read about what is happening in Uttarakhand. Do NOT read illogical news mindlessly based on religion. Read when and what the state government asked, who were the participants and etc. And how the minority community fuel it.",1ao6qyg,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author claims that minorities often exaggerate their victimhood ('play the victim card'), implying insincerity."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""There is a presupposition that media and external actors amplify minority grievances for political reasons."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author suggests that majority resentment is a reaction to perceived minority behavior."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,CAG

Look if you’ve already made up your mind that your fears are justified with what knowledge you’ve consumed on social media regarding violence then it would be inconvenient for you to change your mind, since false narratives are limitless and reality is limited.

Reality is this, minorities are safe in India, safer than most western nations, and it is a teaching in Hinduism not to just live side by side with humans but all living things and nature as well. The fear you hold is irrational as you’ve demonstrated lack of reason to justify it and the will to learn about reality. You could as well be suffering from anxiety and depression as well, you might consider to introspect if that could be a possibility. But there’s no need to have fears regarding country’s future in terms of humanity as this is a democratic and capitalist society with a functioning rule of law.
