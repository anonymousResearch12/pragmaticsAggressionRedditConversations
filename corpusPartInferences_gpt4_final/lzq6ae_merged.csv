IndiaSpeaks,2021-03-07 16:13:17,gq3pal9,wakaboy07,haan. Majority of Varatwasi needs Unlimited call and Limited data for surfing FB n YouTube n Online Gaming. 1.5gb/day is enough. But people like us need little bit multitasking. that 199 monthly plan is good for majority. Vodaphone has 499 probably (4gb/day) That als good for heavy users also. But vodaphone network failure is major issue. Everything is okay untill you as a Network provider provide us wrong or hidden charges or infos.
