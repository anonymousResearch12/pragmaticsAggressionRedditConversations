Why would I keep applying when I get a job I want? Not to mention that breaking your contract can cause the state to hold your license for a year, so I definitely wouldn’t be doing anything after I’ve signed until the next year. In my area, competition is stiff and applying and interviewing is a very time consuming process. There are a few licensure areas that are in high demand, but otherwise there are hundreds of applicants for each position.
