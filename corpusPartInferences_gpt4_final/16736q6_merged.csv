""post_content"": Guys, I have been thinking that most of the doctors or when we Google something related to masturbate or not they always use to say that it is completely healthy and natural,but we the people in this community know that abstaining can make your life and health more better.

So my point is nofap does improve our overall health even immune system too,and if immune system is healthy we don't need any kind of doctors or medicines which can impact these health professionals career and business.Is this true ðŸ¤”",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author distrusts mainstream medical advice regarding masturbation and believes there is a hidden agenda among health professionals."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author presupposes that abstaining from masturbation (nofap) leads to significant health improvements, including immune system enhancement."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author implies that the medical community may downplay the benefits of abstinence to protect their own interests."", ""type"": ""implicature"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",2,representatives,no,PRE,CAG

Masturbation and ejaculation haven't been shown to have any long-term or negative effects on testosterone levels. 

>It's scientifically proven that balls are linked to the brain.

Every part of your body is linked to the brain. That's how human bodies work.

>Monks who want to have control over their mind are celibate.

Not all monks do so. Japanese Buddist monks marry have have sex just like normal people, because they believe the strongest minds can have control over their body regardless of the activities they engage in. Only the weak run away from temptations.
