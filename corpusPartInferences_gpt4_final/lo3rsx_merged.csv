NoFap,,lo3rsx,Emandamn,"""post_title"": Thinking of getting an escort after 90 days + to have some fun

""post_content"": What do you think of this idea? 

I mean the goal is to get a real date but I'm just not ready for that and as a 28 years old virgin with mental issues I'll probably never get a date not to say a successful date.

I think you should aim for a GF. 

And aim to recondition or fix your mental issues asap. Do everything you can from today to fix those issues or make it small enough to be able to date.
