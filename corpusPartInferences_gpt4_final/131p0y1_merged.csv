The truth is we felt left out with you guys in Yugoslavia having fun in the 90s and not including us. So we decided to start killing each other. It was mostly in the south of the country. It started due to the poor economy and a pyramid scheme that took all the savings already poor Albanians had. Greece thought this crisis would be great to cause even more stir in the south so they released from prison in Greece some really bad Albanian guys who returned to the south and ended up causing the death of hundreds thinking they could run towns with the threat of violence. Quite a few women were trafficked into prostitution so families stopped sending girls to school or outside on their own until the situation normalized.",131p0y1,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author uses sarcasm to highlight feelings of exclusion from regional events, implying a sense of marginalization or difference from neighboring countries."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author suggests that the unrest was caused by economic hardship and external interference, particularly from Greece."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author implies that the crisis led to significant social consequences, such as increased violence, trafficking, and changes in family behavior."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",2,representatives,yes,IMP,CAG

AskBalkans,2023-04-29 10:05:35,ji5t113,tnilk,"A lot of people had invested their money into companies which were later found out to be pyramid schemes.

When the news got out and people were denied their money, violent protests broke out mostly in the south. 

There was a lot of political nuance to this, a few ex-gang members escaped from ""high-security"" Greek prisons. They eventually regrouped and taking advantage of the situation turned into road bandits, some eventually taking hold of cities.

The official statement from Greece was that they would enter Albania to protect their minorities, which was later referred to as the ""Liberation of Vorio-Epirus"". Turkey threatened they'd attack Athens if Greece did that.

The oposition at that time created so called ""Salvation commities"", their main goal to usurp the state. A lot of military personnel defacted.

The government back then panicked, decided to open up military depots as their response and a lot of people ended up owning weapons.

This eventually led to new elections and the country was later stabilized, and most of the responsible groups were apprehended and are still serving their sentence.

The general consensus would depend on who you're asking, mostly the south was affected, people in other parts of the country were just broke and afraid of stray bullets by the occasional dumbass who'd gotten hold of a gun.",ji2i8s2,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author provides a detailed, multi-faceted explanation, implying that the unrest was complex and involved both internal and external actors."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author suggests that the official narratives from neighboring countries (Greece, Turkey) were self-serving or manipulative."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author implies that the impact of the unrest was uneven across Albania, with the south being most affected."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.88}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

That's rich considering that we nearly lost the south of the country and the events of '97 lead to a huge number of population losing all their savings and being forced to slave their ass abroad due to severe poverty.
