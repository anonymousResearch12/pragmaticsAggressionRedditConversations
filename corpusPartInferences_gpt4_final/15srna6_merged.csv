Christians,,15srna6,WordandFreedom,"""post_title"": Christian women, God doesn't want you to stay anxious, sick, poor or depressed.

""post_content"": So many Christian women are struggling with anxiety, fear, depression, ill health or lack of finances, and it feels so overwhelming. Yet, God wants you to experience His peace, divine health, wealth and so much more. I wanted to share a free scripture guide, that includes scriptures on various topics so that you can overcome in those areas. As you meditate on these scriptures and allow the Lord to speak the understanding of those scriptures to your heart, you will begin to receive so much more from God.

I believe God has put these people in professions so that we can receive help. However, the way you worded your statement implies that God can never fully heal us on His own, which isn't true.

I have experienced physical healing time and time again through God's word. I used to struggle with low mood for weeks at a time and the Lord set me free from that. God called me to go to Bible College, a course costing about £9000 in total - I had about £2k and needed to leave my job so I could go. I did. God provided every penny over and above what was needed. I absolutely loveeee seeing God's people prosper in every area. He doesn't desire for us to struggle. He loves us so much.
