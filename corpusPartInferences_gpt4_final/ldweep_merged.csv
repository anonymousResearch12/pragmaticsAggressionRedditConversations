Everyone is different everyone's journey is different

Be happy that you have recognised that watching p*** is a problem

What I would recommend you to do is is to set a goal of a short period of time

If you can't reach past 24 hours then try setting goals in hours

I am not saying that you can't set goals in days if you want to you can set your goal in days as well

But it will be better for you to start off small then go to higher numbers",ldweep,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The responder normalizes relapse and individual differences in recovery, reducing stigma."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The responder encourages self-acceptance and incremental goal-setting as a strategy for improvement."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.91}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The responder presupposes that recognizing the problem is a significant positive step."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.89}}",2,directives,yes,IMP,NAG
