Based on your logic, seniors are already receiving dental care, old age security, many get gst rebates, etc etc so they have already received their benefits and don’t need help. That is a flawed argument though because some seniors are doing great, some are not. 

Some business owners are doing great, some are not.

CanadianIdiots,2024-11-30 19:11:47,lzqukp4,Gunslinger7752,"Handouts? The government literally shut businesses down. The government was also picking a choosing who was allowed to stay open and who wasn’t. If it wasn’t for the “handouts” our economy would have been completely screwed. Many businesses and business owners still haven’t recovered. 

Also I’m not sure what you’re talking about but investment income is taxed exactly the same way that any other income is taxed. “Contributing their fair share” is also extremely subjective. Yes there are definitely accounting advantages and loopholes, but if a business owner has 25 employees, they are contributing far more to the economy than you or I even before they pay any personal income tax. The top 1% of earners pay 20% of the income taxes in Canada and the top 20% pay almost 70% of the income taxes. To me that sounds more than fair, but like I said, “fair share” is very subjective. You could also make a valid argument that people making 30-50k are not paying their fair share because they actually have a net gain on the services they receive vs the taxes they pay.",lzqfs0p,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author argues that government support was necessary due to forced business closures, and that many businesses are still struggling."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""2"": {""content"": ""There is a challenge to the claim that investment income is taxed more favorably, asserting that tax fairness is subjective."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.91}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author believes high-income earners already contribute a disproportionate share of taxes."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,CAG
