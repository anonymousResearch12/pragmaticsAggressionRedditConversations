NoFap,,1hhr2nv,Normal-Paper-8151,"""post_title"": I honestly dont see the point

""post_content"": See, in my head, im a functioning addict
The biggest reason why i don’t really care to stop my addiction is because i don’t see a point in dating in this generation.. i’ve had girlfriends before, and the sex was great, but after getting cheated on and actually helping a girl cheat once, i cant find myself trusting women… 
Like sure im lonely, but ive kinda found comfort in it, id just rather keep to myself than to get hurt, or worse, hurt someone else because of my addiction ",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The speaker believes that modern dating is untrustworthy and emotionally risky, especially due to past experiences with infidelity."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The speaker uses addiction as a coping mechanism for loneliness and distrust, finding comfort in isolation rather than risking emotional pain."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The speaker assumes that their addiction is less harmful because they consider themselves 'functional' in daily life."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",2,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
NoFap,2024-12-19 12:44:14,m2t57yn,2saraph2,So don’t date? Who said you need to date women right now? You do know you can *avoid distraction and focus on yourself* for a bit right? I know… sounds crazy… You do know this is the best thing to do as a teenager / young adult right? Don’t be stupid. Of course you know this.

NoFap,2024-12-19 13:56:40,m2tdv9i,2saraph2,"I’m not saying firemen aren’t amazing. I agree, they are extremely courageous, brave people that the world needs to function. You can be a fireman, as well as excel in other areas of life. Start a business outside of work hours. Work on that as well as being a fireman. Work on becoming financially free so you can properly raise your future children with little financial restriction and/or stresses. However, money isn’t everything. Work on building yourself from the ground up as a new man. A strong, disciplined man. Not one that indulges in watching porn and jerking himself off because it just feels good. So what. Who cares. Heroin feels good too. Heroin addicts will argue you can be a functioning heroin addict too. Just saying.

If you want to be the best father you can in the future, it starts with giving up porn ASAP. No good father watches porn behind his family’s backs. Learn to control yourself and your fleshly desires. Sexual discipline is the foundation of real, lasting discipline. Sexual discipline is required for a lasting marriage too.
