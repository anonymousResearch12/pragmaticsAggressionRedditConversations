NoFap,2023-05-21 05:07:43,jkzgki9,newme3323,"I was with you allll the way through your post until the last word: ""intimacy.""

Yes, society unjustly mistreats men. Our sexuality is exploited for others' gain. Recognizing this is wonderful and is great motivation to do NoFap. Seek freedom from manipulation.

However, we are sexual creatures. There is such a thing as healthy sexuality with our wives. ""Intimacy"" is very much a human need, and I don't think it's beneficial to us on this journey to deny that. Intimacy is important, but we can get it in healthy ways. Sexual intimacy is good and one kind of intimacy, but there are other kinds of intimacy that we crave too. Feeling like you're living your life wearing a mask to keep other people happy is a form of inauthenticity. Take off the mask with some trusted friends, and allow yourself to have some emotional intimacy.

Anyway, the way your post ends makes it sound like a girl hurt you and now you're pursing NoFap as a defense mechanism against pain and manipulation by women. I hope that's not the case.",13n33e5,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author agrees that men are mistreated and manipulated by society, but cautions against denying the human need for intimacy."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.96}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author suspects the original poster's motivation for nofap is rooted in personal pain from women, not just societal issues."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author encourages seeking healthy forms of intimacy, including emotional connections with friends."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.91}}",2,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
NoFap,2023-05-21 14:41:30,jl0svq3,nemowerongi,"I just feel like we live in a world where men are being pushed out. 65% of us are single, childless, lonely and are virgin or hasn't had sex in a year. That's way too many young men not to think that we're being marginalized and sacrificed for something. 

If we're going to be denied female companionship and intimacy for years to come or even forever, I want to be mentally ok with that. Intimacy isn't as important as food, water and shelter. I'm 28 and haven't had an intimate relationship with a woman since I was 21. I feel like women now are either too cold and guarded or, too picky.

Yeah my EX hurt me. I cheated and I was sorry but she didn't forgive me and left. I was 20 years old and curious about other women but I swear that's the only slip up I needed to learn. Lol she literally just got married this week too. I don't want to be with her anymore but I have just seen the dark side of women and what they're capable of. They can look you dead in the eyes while they metaphorically sink a knife in your heart deeper and deeper just out of spite. ""Hell has no fury like a woman scorned."" 

I was raised by my dad only and didn't feel important to my mother, growing up, as well.

NoFap,2023-05-21 18:10:23,jl1k5jp,newme3323,"I'm so sorry man. 

I would still push back and say that intimacy is just as important as food, water, and shelter. However, I do think ""intimacy"" means more than ""sexual"" intimacy. Sexual intimacy is only one type of intimacy. Having ""intimate"" (non-sexual) relations with trusted friends and family members is important to our health and mental well-being.

We don't need ""sex"" to live fulfilling lives. We should always seek to love others and accept their love. At the very least, doing so gives us a sense of purpose to protect and care for those whom we love.

It sounds like you've been through a lot and are in a lot of pain. Between your relationship with your mom and the terrible situation you had with your ex when you were 20, you've experienced a lot of trauma with women. These issues with women need to be addressed for your healing and wholeness.

The answer (in my opinion) is not to reject or rule out intimacy in a fit of despair from your situation. Rather, heal your mind and mend your relationships with the opposite sex. Have platonic friendships. Foster female friendships that you really care about and would never consider turning into romantic relationships. You can receive love and intimacy from your platonic friendships, and maybe one day a friendship will naturally blossom into something deeper.

Stick to your NoFap plan. Develop self-discipline and become the man you want to be. You don't need sexual pleasure to be fulfilled. You don't need to be manipulated by your desires and impulses. Keep on fighting and working towards healing, bro. That's what this is all about for us.

NoFap,2023-05-21 18:21:39,jl1lr94,nemowerongi,"I hear ya man. Thanks a lot actually for taking the time out to have a dialogue.

I would say way too many of us young men do lack just regular friendships, family relationships, etc. I think it's a sign we're in a pretty dark place in society. Like I said before, I feel like it's being done to us on purpose so i would admit I am pretty guarded up with everything. Either we've given up on society or porn is modifying our minds to handle real life relationship unnaturally. More than likely a mixture of both.

I've gotten really used to being alone especially after covid so I think imma just get stable and grounded with nofap first then work on my relationships if I ever do at all. I'm just at a point where life isn't about happiness anymore, just survival. So, I just treat people with respect but not very jovial about it.

NoFap,2023-05-21 18:48:49,jl1pnxe,newme3323,"Np man. 

Yeah, I'd agree it's a mixture of both. Society has changed so much. It's like the chicken vs. the egg argument with porn. Did porn make society this way or did society make porn this way? I think it's both. Never before in history could people have instant access to pictures, text, and videos of what arouses them and floods their brains with dopamine. Same deal with our food supply... we have practically instant access to sugary, salty, savory foods. We've become a society of hedonists who don't know the value of self-control. Self-control and discipline are often mocked for being anti-freedom and anti-self-expression. I'll gladly accept all the mocking to be disciplined and achieve true freedom from slavery. 

Happiness is a mindset my dude. Happiness isn't based in what you have or don't have but rather your attitude towards your situation. A 600 pound guy on a weight loss journey can be one of the happiest people around. He was 800 pounds a year ago. Progress towards goals and pride in our accomplishments can help us decide to be happy. It's a choice. 

Working on relationships should come hand in hand with nofap. Chatting with me is working on a friendship. You're making progress without realizing it!
