""post_content"": Anyone whoâ€™s doing their first listen to this thing whilst doing something else, like anything else like even if ur scrolling through your phone, putting some clothes away, going to the gym. Stop. Stop listening and wait for a better time. I can 100% guarantee youâ€™re gonna get so much more from this album if you set some time aside to only just listen to the album. Lie down in your bed, close your eyes, stick this on with some good headphones, and really feel the music.

KendrickLamar,2022-05-13 22:06:45,i8hsrtq,BanMutsang,"Yeahh I suppose so. But it doesnâ€™t mean people shouldnâ€™t at least try to devote all their attention to it. A lot of ppl donâ€™t try hard enough, if they just stick in there, even if it requires some effort, itâ€™ll transform how they hear music, not just for this album.

KendrickLamar,2022-05-14 00:29:52,i8ibz1e,Fail_Succeed_Repeat,"Iâ€™m saying listen how you choose to listen, just make sure you do it multiple times because no one is going to form a full opinion on the first listen through.

After my first listen, I loved the album and thought it was so different to his previous works and appreciated it for that reason, and it hit me really deep, some of the topics he was discussing really hit home for me. But because that wasnâ€™t the case for you, it canâ€™t be the case for anyone else??? People need perspective. Damn.
