Chinese,2024-09-13 20:04:30,lmyq87o,travel_posts,"i never said im chinese, but i live here. im just trying to make sure you dont embarass yourself by bringing up american propaganda shit. its not about his name at all, just referancing politics when its irrelevant. 

its not a ban at all, its firstly just a different media ecosystem and secondly a contract thing. artists or their publishing company will sign different contracts with different outlets, so when foreigners sign for netease its usually just the rights for china. if youre outside of china and using netease it wont be availble because they already have a contract with western apps for those regions. 

>hurting the goodness of a beautiful culture with that attitude

telling people to avoid the bing chilling and social credit shit is actually standong up for and defending them from western chauvinism.

also, im not mad. i get that youre young and that shit is normal on the western internet. i do the same thing over here for chinese people when there copying american edgy jokes or think saying the nword is funny. they dont have the context to know that shit is corny and offensive. i dont want them saying the wrong thing to the wrong person and getting in trouble",lmym601,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author clarifies that their criticism was about political references, not personal offense or nationality."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author provides an informed explanation of Chinese music industry practices and region locking."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author positions themselves as a cultural mediator, aiming to prevent cross-cultural misunderstandings."", ""type"": ""commissives"", ""confidence"": 0.91}}",3,commissives,yes,IMP,NAG
