""post_content"": Why TF does my province use an emergency broadcast over the cell networks that is the exact same system used to give warning about natural disasters... Use it for a lost child. Like, stop the whole province, this is deadly serious, everyone could be impacted, by a lost fucking child. One minor, probably abducted by a family member, and my Tiktok has to stop.

There’s a difference between going out in public and being annoyed by misbehaved children that the parents won’t quiet or remove/should have gotten a babysitter for to begin with vs a matter of life and death.
