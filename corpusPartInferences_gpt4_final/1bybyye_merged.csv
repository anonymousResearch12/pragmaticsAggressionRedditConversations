""post_content"": So I take care of my kid & they trying to put me on child support because of the Medicaid. One of my friends said that him and his girlfriend told the court they just want the Medicaid. They don‚Äôt want to do the part where they pay for the other part & me & my girlfriend wanted to do the same thing. Have yall ever heard of anybody only paying Medicaid part of the child support?
