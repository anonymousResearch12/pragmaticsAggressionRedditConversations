humming or singing a song several times.

listening to music.

reading (forwards and backwards)

talking with others.

exercise.

ignoring the voices.

medication (important to include).

I understand that what you're going through is tough, and I can't imagine myself in your shoes.

Me helping others at times is good for me, at least that's what I think. Just know, that you aren't alone in this, and others are experiencing it too. I just need you to realise that self harm isn't good. I need you to just deeply think about what self harm causes.

I also need you too start thinking more positively of yourself, and look at yourself in a  whole new light of positivity. Think about what you're good at, maybe drawing? Maybe playing video games? Anything. And if not, then surely you can try something new if you put your mind to it.
