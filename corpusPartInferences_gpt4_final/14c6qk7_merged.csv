shortguys,2023-06-18 03:51:37,joje3jx,Internal_Group8784,"Yup I agree with you. The counter argument is you’re indirectly or maybe even directly saying short=bad tall=good. But what people don’t realize is that they didn’t make that decision on their own and it was society that made the decision for him/her. And it also depends on what u mean on “gender norms” if u mean what “average range” is for the persons country and gender, than I would agree with you, but I wouldn’t say that a 5’10 guy in the west doing it to become 6’3 is doing it to be “closer to gender norms”.",jojc1b1,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Societal standards, not individual choices, drive the association of height with value."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.94}, ""2"": {""content"": ""There is nuance in what constitutes 'gender norms' and not all height increases are for the same reasons."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.91}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author partially agrees with the previous message but adds complexity to the argument."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.88}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

shortguys,2023-06-18 04:08:33,jojfvu1,skncareaddict,"Gender norms to me means at least 5’8 (the global average for men) but ideally 5’9’5-5’11. 6 ft and up is 90th-95th percentile most people globally aren’t that tall it’s just media propaganda. Tall men are at the forefront in media, business and politics so those are the faces you see most. 

The gender norm/expectation is to be taller then some women as someone who is 5’4 (4th percentile) I don’t even come close to that. That’s what I mean, not this idealistic reality that every single guy is 6 ft. That’s impossible there will always be someone that’s average or shorter than average but realistically you want to be average so you can be a productive member to society without major backlash.",joje3jx,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Media and societal expectations exaggerate the 'ideal' male height, which is not reflective of global averages."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Height-based expectations affect social participation and acceptance."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author feels excluded from gender norms due to being significantly below average height."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
shortguys,2023-06-18 05:23:10,jojnoge,Internal_Group8784,"Gender norms doesn’t have to mean 5’8 though, like someone 5’1 going to 5’6 can still definitely be doing it for gender norms, as 5’6 is much more common than 5’1 is for men, and not to mention it’s two inches above the average female height. But even a 4’11 guy that’s going to 5’4 could be doing it to be closer to gender norms. Also I’m pretty sure the global average 5’7 but I could be mistaken, but 5’7 is the start of being in the “average” or “typical” range for an adult male so I definitely wouldn’t say “at least 5’8” but really there’s no “at least”, as long as the person got what they wanted from the surgery.",jojfvu1,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Gender norms are relative and not fixed at a specific height; improvement towards average is valid."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author challenges the notion of a strict height threshold for gender norms."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.91}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Personal satisfaction with surgical outcomes is more important than meeting arbitrary standards."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.89}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
shortguys,2023-06-18 05:45:43,jojpwhz,skncareaddict,"That’s what I meant “closer to” doesn’t mean you absolutely have to hit that specific mark because everyone has a limit gaining 10 inches is impossible. Someone that’s 4’11 might only get to 5’4 but that’s still way better than 4’11.

I know that I have it better than a guy that’s 4’11 I can acknowledge that. But I feel like guys that are around average height can’t acknowledge it or simply refuse to acknowledge it.
