Realise that wet dreams are not relapses because sperm isnt magic juice.  Stop trying to 'control your dreams'

NoFap,2021-04-20 20:58:41,gv8h71u,Mayafoe,"oh, you're commenting on a comment thread of mine and a post of mine at the same time.

here, read this:

Your sperm doesn't magically contain your 'benefits', 'superpowers' or 'progress'.
Sperm has ONE JOB: *to deliver genetic information to an egg*.  No more, no less.  It does not give a dude 'confidence'... or 'energy' or 'concentration'.  It's very easy for a male to make sperm, it's literally our main function and we do it without difficulty. *Sperm doesn't help you with any other part of your life any more than your ears help you to smell something*. The problem is that after a relapse it *feels* like all the benefits are lost with the ejaculation of sperm, you get that 'drained' feeling for a short time afterwards... but logically that can't be true:

If sperm was magic juice then men having sex would suffer as much as celibate fappers...**but they don't!**. If it was true then women wouldn't benefit from reducing their fapping and porn... ***but they do***  *because they can also be addicted.*  The problem here, the addiction, lies in our brain and our behavior, not in our sperm. It's neither the cause of the problem nor the solution to how we can improve our lives.

Of course, fapping 10 times a day will result in a nutrient loss (take a daily multivitamin), but the real problem is our *addiction* to the ***behavior of watching porn, fapping and having an orgasm we give ourselves!***.  One occasional loss of sperm does not have any negative biological consequence.

HOWEVER... by indulging in irrational ""semen retention"" fantasies on this sub *THREE VERY SERIOUS HARMS ARE CREATED FOR USERS HERE*:


PROBLEM #1   A guy who has a 30-day streak but breaks it won't see his progress, only his failure, if he thinks his sperm 'contains' his 'benefits' rather than the benefit coming from his EFFORT over that month to change his habits. (what OTHER positive activities did he or she begin during that month? THAT will have measurable benefits).  **We have all seen the post that says, ""WAAAH I fapped one time after a 534-day streak and now I lost all my benefitsssss ....aaaaahhh I'm going to kill myself""**

Those poor guys who say that are delusional... and yet we see this attitude here every day.

PROBLEM #2 ...The idea that sperm is magic wizard juice that 'holds' benefits is the reason people ask, ""can I have sex with my girlfriend/wife while doing nofap?"" 

This is, in general, nofap, not no-sex.  Holding in your sperm, with-holding sex from your partner or yourself will not turn you into some cartoonish wizard-superhero.  Saying to guys, ""Dont have sex with your wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, husband"" makes this sub look insane... live your REAL life and enjoy sex with your partner.

PROBLEM #3  Though this guy says wet dreams, nightfall (a negative-toned label for something positive) are 'not a relapse'... the vast majority of semen retention fantasists DO call them a relapse... look at the hysterical guy elsewhere in these comments who is so tense about them that he's trying to police his dreams and stop wet dreams in his subconscious.. in case he loses his magic juice by accident,  naturally. It's a healthy, biologically natural occurence...especially for non-fappers.  It was a sexy dream, dude.  Enjoy it, clean up and move forward.
