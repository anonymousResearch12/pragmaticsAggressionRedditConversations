uberdrivers,,143ocnt,bandofwarriors,"""post_title"": $2.21 on $42.50

""post_content"": Just picked up and order that had a 1 mile delivery for $2.21 just for the hell of it.
When I deliver the order which took 10 minutes to find the person, I handed them their order and as I was handing it off I noticed the total on the receipt.. $42.53
So that's how they're doing this on UberEats guys... If you didn't already know.

uberdrivers,2023-06-07 22:57:50,jnb2umk,bandofwarriors,"I find that sometimes if you take a low ball order it will stimulate the algorithm and get orders going for you that's the only reason I took it, if the first order of the day I get is a low ball order I usually take it just so I don't get off on a bad foot with the ""algorithm"".
Flimsy logic I know, but it seems like it works sometimes.
For the first time in over 5,000 orders I actually talked to the customer about a tip on this order. All I told him was ""you know how much I get paid on this? $2.00"".

Worry about what you're getting paid and don't accept horrible offers unless it's to complete a quest.
