""post_content"": Not sure what type of actions could be taken if any against this.
I saw my job posted up on Indeed, I've had some medical issues as of late to cause me to come in late or take a couple days off. However, I've always made up my time and even have several documentations from my doctor that HR has.
Kind of stressing this, as no one has heard about them looking for another person. I'm going to ask my boss about it before I leave but if she says no and then turns around and does it regardless, do I have any leverage?",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author suspects their employer may be planning to replace them despite assurances to the contrary."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author believes that having medical documentation and making up missed time should protect them from termination."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author is experiencing significant anxiety and uncertainty about job security."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

Asking them if you are being fired is looking for trouble.  There is no advantage to this whatsoever.  Even if they pinky swear you can keep your job, there is nothing binding them to it.

They don't take into consideration we have things outside of our job, theres a point system to where if you're even on time, you're late. When my health got bad, I communicated this with them, doctors note and everything. They decided to deduct my pay by 20k. I still stayed and did the work and did the overtime. Only a few can work from home and I requested that after having surgery and they denied me, thus deduction in my pay.
Everything has been documented, and obviously the ""chats"" I have with my boss or HR have all been recorded.

However, the last conversation I had with my boss and HR, my boss acted like I didn't even call or text her I was going to be late that day. I had to show HR proof off of my phone.

I know its not a great company and I should be looking elsewhere (1 star reviews on Glassdoor) but I feel comfortable in my environment.

careerguidance,2024-05-01 02:12:41,l20rkvn,Snoo_38398,"So I wanted to ask for advice again. Today, things were off... I just pick up on things. One of the people who do the second rounds of interviewing for manufacturing management jobs was called into my bosses office. She just came up to him and asked her to go to her office which is within eye distance for me. They closed the door. Now she never closes the door unless it's something that shouldn't be heard.
Then I felt like I got tested today, I had multiple people come up to me with questions I've never even conversed with before.
Then a girl no one knew in my department (I'm a buyer/purchasing) was escorted to my bosses office and once again the door got shut. I tried to listen through the walls while my other coworkers were trying to listen through other means (I know) but ultimately couldn't hear anything because it was the perfect time for the girl across my bosses office to shred things.
So initially, if you get a second interview it's three main people, and one happens to be my best friend but she's the one who trains everyone...but it would be a conflict because they would know she would tell me or give me a heads up.
So when I left for work today, I made an excuse at the receptionist asking her if one of my vendors had came here because I was ""waiting"" for him, but this allowed me to see the sign in sheet...and yes multiple people for interviews. Again, no one in my buying department has been told there is an open position.

I do have an interview at another company, funny enough it's at my coworkers/best friend  husband's work.",l1t9le9,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author suspects covert preparations for their replacement at work."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.94}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author is hyper-vigilant and possibly anxious about workplace dynamics."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author is actively seeking alternative employment as a precaution."", ""type"": ""commissives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,NAG
