weed,2021-10-18 20:48:18,hh52nom,yesterdaylettuce420,"Yess i just got the same email. You want to think your safe buying from dispensaries but you aren't. I've bought clones with infestations, weed with fly larvae, weed with mold in it. I have friends that work in the industry and a lot of places are just selling trash. They like to keep it in bags behind the counter and offer you ""a really good deal"" then you get home and realize why it was behind the counter and why it was so cheap. You would think these things wouldn't happen with all the tax revenue they can put back into it.",qat4df,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Dispensaries are not necessarily safe or trustworthy sources for cannabis products."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.96}, ""2"": {""content"": ""There is a systemic problem in the cannabis industry with product quality and transparency."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author is frustrated and disillusioned with the current state of the legal cannabis market."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,CAG
