AskIndia,,1hokyc4,multrix51,"""post_title"": Is there any NGO or groups organizing beach cleaning ?

""post_content"": I‚Äôm amazed by all the trash at mahabalipuram on the beach, while thousands of people come here as part of their pilgrim.

No one ever felt like it would be a good idea to make a group action and beach will be clean after 10 minutes of common effort ? As a foreigner I don‚Äôt feel like I should organize that. I hope that some locals sometimes do that. All India beaches and nature are just dump sites‚Ä¶",,"{

And if its a serotonin based activity you want to perform you should do it yourself theres no harm in that. NGOs are just another way to perform scam like money laundering etc so i dont think that is going to cut it. Its okay reddit is full of naive questions like you asked.,m4aebwz,"{
