""post_content"": I work as a bouncer for a bar near a uni and I've been noticing a large increase in terrible quality digital fake ids floating around. Has anyone else noticed this? Im not exactly sure about policies when it comes to confiscating ""digital fake ids"" and will ask the boss soon enough. This is a bit of a special case because this is quite a recent trend but I was wondering if anyone had as similar experience or any tips when it comes to dealing with digital fakies?",,"{

Your employer could also be charged or sued too and you are massive liability if you think you can act like that.


Also if someone is using a fake ID they are probably underage and have nudes on their phone. You see where I am going here? How is it going to look when a crying underage girl claims you stole her phone to get access to her nudes and the phone as well as the photos are in your possession?
