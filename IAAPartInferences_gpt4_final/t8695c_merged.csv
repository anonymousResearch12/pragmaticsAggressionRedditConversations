Trump made the change okaying the sale of more weapons to Ukraine. In Dec. 2017 Trump made that change and it riled Russia.

This war has nothing to do with Trump or any other president. This war has to do with NATO expansion.

In 2008 Russia bluntly warned the US that NATO expansion could lead to military conflict. They've been saying the same thing since then.

**This war is all about NATO expansion!**

When we announced Ukraine was going to join our offensive military alliance Russia strenuously objected. When we started arming Ukraine Russia then set its ""red line.""

Russia then sought a treaty to prevent NATO expansion but Biden rejected that before the diplomats even met. The US then started flooding weapons and NATO military trainers into Ukraine. That left Russia with no choice but war.

Russia sees Ukraine joining NATO as an *existential threat* -- they'll go nuclear over this issue.

The US doesn't learn. We provoked Russia into launching a war and now we're talking about sending Ukraine weapons from Poland and advanced jets. This has a serious potential to develop into WWIII.",t8695c,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author asserts that NATO expansion, not US presidential politics, is the primary cause of the war."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.97}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author presupposes that Russia views NATO expansion as an existential threat, justifying extreme responses."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author implies that US actions provoked Russia into war, shifting blame from Russia to the US and NATO."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.94}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,NAG,

Correct. Biden is being a friggin' idiot.

IMO the US deliberately sought to provoke Russia into a war. It's just like our secret plan to provoke the USSR into sending troops to defend a friendly gov't in Afghanistan decades ago. That was a deliberate US strategy *to provoke* action and to trap them in a guerrilla war.

Obama threatened to trap Russia in a guerrilla war in Syria but the Russians won that one.

Now the US is doing that using Ukraine. Logic would state there are 2 options in play, that:

* If the US wanted a war -- say because Washington decided to turn Ukraine into Syria and trap the Russians in a guerrilla war -- then Biden got his war.  Mission accomplished!

* If the US did not want a war then this has to be classified as a complete and total blunder by Biden.  

  The US attitude through the entire run-up before the war was to treat the Russians like a minor country instead of the dominant power in eastern Europe. What would have happened if the US tact towards negotiations were softer and more different? What if the US had proposed a 10 year delay on Ukrainian NATO membership or some such thing?

Bullshit.

This invasion happened because Putin is still fighting the Cold War and thinks he can put the Soviet Union back together. He's insane. 

It's not NATO, it's not Nazis, it's not the Donbas region. Those are shitty Russian propaganda claims.

worldpolitics2,3/7/2022 1:19,hzn4hna,IntnsRed,"You're spouting US propaganda.

In the big reveal of US State Dept cables given to Wikileaks by Bradley/Chelsea Manning, in 2008 the Russians sent the US a bluntly worded statement that incorporating Georgia and Ukraine would lead to military conflict. That was **2008**.

In the years since Russia has been consistent: they oppose NATO expansion.

They've tolerated US-funded colored revolutions but they oppose expanding NATO.

We see this in the past year. They asked for a treaty about stopping NATO expansion. Biden's administration rejected that before diplomats even met. Then the US started flooding Ukraine with weapons and NATO military trainers. With the US position already set, diplomacy went nowhere so Russia was left with no other option except war.

The war with Georgia was not initiated by Russia. There was a peace agreement in place agreed to by Georgia, Russia and Europe's OSCE. Georgia had its army trained by US Marines and with their new training and US supplied weapons they attacked the mostly-Russian peacekeepers and launched an offensive to retake the disputed areas.

Russia counter attacked, kicked the Georgian army's ass and drive deep into Georgia. After firmly sending the message ""we can come back"" Russia then withdrew.
