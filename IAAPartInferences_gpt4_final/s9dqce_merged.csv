antinatalism,,s9dqce,PantherPower83,"""post_title"": Overpopulation and inflation.

""post_content"": Has anyone else noticed the obvious correlation between overpopulation and the inflation that has been happening as of lately? We can talk about supply and demand how it’s driving up the price for housing but the real culprit here is that there is simply too many people, too many people breeding recklessly and too many people who refuse to take these things into consideration. More land is being taken away and more plants and animals are being destroyed to build housing for selfish humans who breed recklessly without taking into account other species. Selfish humans to breed purely for their own egotistical reasons.",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author believes overpopulation is the primary cause of inflation, especially in housing."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author holds a negative view of people who have children without considering environmental or economic consequences, labeling them as selfish and egotistical."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author presupposes that human population growth directly leads to environmental destruction and loss of biodiversity."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,CAG,

Does it look like inflation correlates to population to you? 

There are red bars on there for years with massive deflation. By your theory, those would be years of dropping population or something? 

Inflation is a lot more complicated than simply stemming from an increasing population.",htop31x,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author provides evidence (a chart) to refute the claim that inflation correlates with population growth."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.94}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author suggests that the OP's theory is overly reductive and ignores other factors influencing inflation."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.87}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG,
