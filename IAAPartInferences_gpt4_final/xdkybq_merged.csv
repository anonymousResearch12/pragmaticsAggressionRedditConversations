""post_content"": hello everyone! i'm going to my first ever AEW show tomorrow in albany and i can't wait! i've been to a ton of WWE shows before and i know that if you get to the arena early, you can sometimes meet the wrestlers by the buses/stage door/whatever area it is that they enter through. i know people wait outside after the shows for this too. is this something that you can do with AEW too or is that not really a thing? i'm really just looking to meet mox, honestly. any information would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author assumes that meeting wrestlers outside the arena is a common and acceptable practice at wrestling events."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author values personal interaction with specific wrestlers (especially Mox) over general fan experiences."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.88}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author presupposes that AEW and WWE have similar fan engagement practices."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,yes,PRE,NAG,

I'd love to meet Mox too, but I figure my best bet was to buy seats along is usual entrance route and try for a fist bump.

AEWOfficial,9/14/2022 2:02,iobu5ty,princessfranchitti,"i saw that, but unfortunately don't care about any of them enough to buy the ticket for it. i appreciate you telling me about it though!

that's exactly where my seat is, haha. i never considered waiting outside the arena itself bad manners and/or stalkery though, do other people consider it that way?? obviously going to their hotel, the airport, following them to restaurants after the show, those are all bad manners unless you just happen to bump into them, but i've stood outside of an arena for many many shows and never had anyone say anything bad to me. of course, i'm also very quiet and respectful in these situations, would never scream at them or call them names for NOT coming over... these are things i've seen and it just makes me shake my head. they're people too!",iobsre2,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author distinguishes between respectful and disrespectful fan behavior, seeing waiting outside the arena as acceptable if done politely."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author believes that celebrities should expect some fan presence outside venues."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author disapproves of aggressive or entitled fan behavior."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.87}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,NAG,

Forgot to mention initially that when I went to the show in CT earlier this year, Tony brought out Adam Cole for an exclusive promo and meet and greet after the show. I highly doubt Mox would be pulling extra duty in that role since he's supposed to be taking time off right now, but hopefully another big name will be out there for us.",iobu5ty,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Some wrestlers are more open to informal fan interactions than others."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.91}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Chance encounters with wrestlers outside the arena are rare and unpredictable."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.89}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Special meet and greet opportunities are sometimes arranged unexpectedly."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.87}}",1,representatives,uncertain,IMP,NAG,

Yep. They just got off work. Would you want random strangers waiting for you once you got off work? They have paid meet and greets for a reason.

&gt;they're people too!

Agreed!

AEWOfficial,9/14/2022 2:51,ioc0v9o,slujj-vohaul,"I didn’t call it stalkery, that was another person. But I do think it’s kinda rude and wrestlers certainly shouldn’t “expect it”.

Celebrities are people too. They are tired after work and deserve privacy. If you want to meet your favorite, I suggest waiting for an opportunity to do so via a paid event. 

Sounds like your mind is already made up though, so I dunno why you’re seeking validation.",iobwr8x,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author believes that waiting outside the arena is rude and that wrestlers should not be expected to interact with fans after work."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author perceives the other participant as seeking validation rather than information."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.89}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,CAG,
AEWOfficial,9/14/2022 3:13,ioc3sgw,princessfranchitti,"i'm not seeking validation, i'm just confused by you saying that because this happens at almost every concert/play/live sporting event/comedy show/live celebrity event that has ever existed. all i wanted to know was if people did it for aew too and if they'd ever had success. i think the minute you leave the premises of the arena/theater/venue/whatever is when it become bad manners. most of the venues i've gone to for WWE have barricades set up outside the doors for this very purpose, so the wrestlers can come up to the barricade, sign things/take pictures, and go back inside/go home if it's after the event.",ioc0v9o,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author believes that waiting outside venues for celebrities is a widespread and normalized practice."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author distinguishes between acceptable and unacceptable fan behavior based on location and context."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,NAG,
