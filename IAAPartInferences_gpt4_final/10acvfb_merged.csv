""post_content"": So I accidentally swiped left trying to scroll and compliment this woman. While trying to respond with the compliment, the app registered it as swiping left got a pop up at the top left saying I missed a match. I didn’t want to pay money to get the like back.

Yes you lost the match. Don't be insecure about it with your anxiety. If shes attractive she probably has hundreds of dudes in her inbox and its unlikely you ever had a shot anyway. Abundance mindset my bro!

Do me a favor and look up anxious attachment styles real quick. You're gonna need it!",10acvfb,"{

But def come at online dating from a strong abundance mindset and zero expectations. Its a numbers &amp; timing game. Girls get a lot of attention so end up getting quite the decision paralysis. If another guy sparks her interest just enough you will get ignored for seemingly no reason at all. Only for her to come back and forget you existed.

Bumble,1/14/2023 2:40,j49bq0q,tidepodforbreakfast,"When you make an account on either your profile gets 'boosted' to the top of the stack so you get a lot of interest really early on. You can game this a bit by purchasing premium on either. It does this as well. So if you select a small subscription window you get a free boost. Not that I endorse spending money on dating apps... but there is something to be said about hinge premium and bumble premium

Hinge in particular benefits a lot from premium because of the like limit. I found girls rarely spend time swiping but that is my feeling, and ultimately its a numbers game. So if you aren't initiating you won't get a lot of interest. I don't believe they have any incentive to swipe.

Just a protip for bumble - i've found that if you don't match with a girl who liked you relatively quickly they get a little butthurt and wont send that first message after you match with them. They'll just let it expire. I have much better results being timely on bumble. I've found girls on hinge don't really care because they dont have to make a move and sending them a message moves you to the top anyway. Just my intuition though.

Don't be afraid to move quickly and get girls out on dates after 5-10 messages. They get bored and ultimately another guy will.",j49ahoo,"{
