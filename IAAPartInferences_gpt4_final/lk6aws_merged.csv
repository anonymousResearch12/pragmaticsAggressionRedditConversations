""post_content"": The verdict is I don't know. I was unconscious the whole time so I can't know. I can't say that he did assault me and I can't say he didn't assault me. I don't have any real memories from when I was unconscious.

TwoXChromosomes,2/15/2021 13:35,gnj23hh,[deleted],"You do know. Nobody in their right mind would do that. Even if you can't know if they assaulted you, you know they have boundary issues. Everyone knows that you're not supposed to ""just climb into someone's bed"". Hell, I wouldn't even do it to my female friends, when I am a female myself. BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE PERSONAL SPACE. And personal space needs to be respected. The only time you can sleep next to someone is when you get their consent for it. Even if just sleeping next to someone is not a crime, it's also not socially acceptable. Regardless of what happened, I would feel unsafe and I would never talk to that person again and would tell everyone in my close vicinity about what happened so that they could avoid that person.",gnih9in,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The speaker strongly asserts that entering someone's bed without consent is a violation of social norms and personal boundaries."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.97}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The speaker implies that the OP does know the seriousness of the situation, even if they claim uncertainty."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.93}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The speaker recommends social consequences for the man, such as warning others and cutting off contact."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.91}}",1,representatives,no,PRE,CAG,

TwoXChromosomes,2/16/2021 10:38,gnmqcpc,[deleted],"Why are you trying to pretend that it's ok for someone else to climb into your bed? As I said, they can't know if anything happened. It could have been that the person truly just did sleep next to them and didn't even touch them. But for me, that's a MAJOR red flag, especially if you don't know them or they're just some random person from school/work/hobby etc. Amd I would warn all of my friends that if you pass out next to that dude, they can end up in your bed.",gnl8pow,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The speaker maintains that entering someone's bed without consent is a serious warning sign, regardless of intent."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The speaker suggests that others should be warned about the man's behavior to prevent future incidents."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}}",1,representatives,no,PRE,CAG,

Of course its a fucking red flag. Doesn't mean OP needs to be sure of anything. Maybe they'll never know, maybe time will reveal some truths. For now they don't know.

TwoXChromosomes,2/16/2021 11:06,gnms169,[deleted],"I just agreed with the previous person that that dude is a scumbag. Sure, they might not have done anything but they're definitely not people you would like to hang around with. Could they be awesome and they just had a weird lapse of judgement and didn't think? Sure. But is it worth it being around a person that did a super sketchy thing just because there's a chance they're cool? In my opinion, no. If OP chooses to though, it's their choice and they indeed do know the situation better. But too many women also lull themselves into a false sense of security and then next time something does happen.

TwoXChromosomes,2/16/2021 11:35,gnmtuby,[deleted],"Why is it wrong to try to change someone's mind? People do it all the time. It's only wrong if you dog a person about for weeks/months/ years and can't let it go even after they've made up their mind and told you so or asked you to stop trying. It is, in the end always the person's choice what they wish to think or do. As I said, I'm just trying to look out for OP.
