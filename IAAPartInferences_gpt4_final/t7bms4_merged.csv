AskARussian,,t7bms4,pinkhairedbiatch,"""post_title"": Russian artists of reddit: how have the sanctions impacted you?

""post_content"": I had tickets to a Russian ballet in my town, but it got cancelled because of the war. It's sad, since it's not the ballerinas' fault that their leader is a dictator, as a former ballerina myself knowing the amount of time, pain and effort it takes physically hurts.

So how are other artists affected? Singers? Actors? Actresses? Maybe even some dancers are here? Or other artists of the sort? How does it make you feel and how do you cope?",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The speaker believes that sanctions unfairly impact ordinary Russian artists who are not responsible for political decisions."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The speaker empathizes with Russian artists, especially dancers, due to personal experience and emotional connection."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The speaker assumes that sanctions have widespread effects on various types of artists, not just dancers."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG,
