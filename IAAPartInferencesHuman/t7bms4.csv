AskARussian,,t7bms4,pinkhairedbiatch,"""post_title"": Russian artists of reddit: how have the sanctions impacted you?

""post_content"": I had tickets to a Russian ballet in my town, but it got cancelled because of the war. It's sad, since it's not the ballerinas' fault that their leader is a dictator, as a former ballerina myself knowing the amount of time, pain and effort it takes physically hurts.

So how are other artists affected? Singers? Actors? Actresses? Maybe even some dancers are here? Or other artists of the sort? How does it make you feel and how do you cope?",,"{""content"":""The OP thinks that it is unfair for ballerinas to bear the consequences of the war."", ""type"":""expressives""},{""content"":""The OP thinks that other artists might also be affected negatively."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The OP has negative views towards the Russian political leaders."", ""type"":""expressives""}  ",The OP thinks that it is unfair for ballerinas to bear the consequences of the war.,expressives,yes,IMP,NAG,
