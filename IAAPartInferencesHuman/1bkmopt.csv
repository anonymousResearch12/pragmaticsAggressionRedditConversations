AfterMidnight,,1bkmopt,Pin-Last,"""post_title"": I’d post about the Jeff Probst episode…

""post_content"": …but I can only take so many downvotes before I get the hint. 
I literally can’t find a bigger Taylor fan than me. 
It’s true love. 
Now that we’ve established that…

There's a lot to love about her, but to be completely frank, you're starting to sound a bit creepy with just how much you're into her. Please dial it back some, and promise yourself that you'll never try to find her IRL.

Even better, I never criticized her. I just said I can see why she felt intimidated. I literally defended her. But you're overly obsessed so you need to declare me a problem so you can feel good ""defending"" her.
