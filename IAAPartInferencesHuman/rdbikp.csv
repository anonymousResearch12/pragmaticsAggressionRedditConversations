They are certainly not the same, nobody ever said they were, but they seem to me broadly similar in structure.

You would be wrong in assuming I'm defending crypto at all. To quote my own comment:

&gt;Thank you for bringing this up. Git isn't decentralized, it's not burning through energy pointlessly calculating hashes to add value to your code push, forgetting your account password doesn't keep you from accessing your code forever, you would have to be really creative to use it to launder money, and competing projects can't gang up to change your code.

Cryptographic verification of file integrity isn't what is unique or problematic about cryptocurrency, and git (or GitHub) wouldn't be useful if it was only that. 

Saying lawnmower technology is the same as car technology because they share internal combustion is a huge stretch.

I just mean that internal combustion engines are all broadly similar (thus the category ""internal combustion engine""), so saying that a car engine works like a lawnmower engine is...entirely accurate..??

The GitHub analogy (which was explicitly not exact) was to say that the blockchain is (not exclusively) a sort of ledger of all the shit that's happened on it, just like GitHub is sorta like a ledger of all the shit that happens on it 

Ya, it's a crude analogy that doesn't get at the major differences that the layperson wouldn't understand

Anyone familiar with either is going to disagree with that, and that is probably the issue with making rough analogies. 

If you're going to bitch about cryptocurrency, which is the context of the episode, claiming the technology isn't notable because it uses cryptography to verify file integrity is weird. It's a true statement that doesn't matter, because what is notable about it isn't like git. 

It's like saying git is whatever technology because file systems and package managers use the same technology.

behindthebastards,12/13/2021 14:00,hodh5nc,Albrew,"I mean the point of rough analogies is that they're for those who are NOT familiar.

Like I don't know a ton about engines, so it makes sense to say that lawnmower and car engines are similar. You put fuel in, it burns with spark plugs and pistons and shit, you gotta oil it now and again, and it makes a mechanical rotation motion that can bee transferred to wheels. No shit the mechanics aren't the same, but they do broadly the same task, namely making petrol into motion. They even do that in a similar way, igniting it to push pistons.

Is it accurate to say that the blockchain functions, at least partially, as/thru a list of interactions?
