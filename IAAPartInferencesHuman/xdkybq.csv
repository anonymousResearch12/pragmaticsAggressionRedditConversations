AEWOfficial,,xdkybq,princessfranchitti,"""post_title"": meeting wrestlers before show?

""post_content"": hello everyone! i'm going to my first ever AEW show tomorrow in albany and i can't wait! i've been to a ton of WWE shows before and i know that if you get to the arena early, you can sometimes meet the wrestlers by the buses/stage door/whatever area it is that they enter through. i know people wait outside after the shows for this too. is this something that you can do with AEW too or is that not really a thing? i'm really just looking to meet mox, honestly. any information would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",,"{""content"":""The OP is considering saving money but meeting wrestlers before the show by getting to the arena early and waiting at places these wrestlers enter through or waiting outside after the show."", ""type"":""representatives""}",The OP is considering saving money but meeting wrestlers before the show by getting to the arena early and waiting at places these wrestlers enter through or waiting outside after the show.,representatives,no,IMP,NAG,

I'd love to meet Mox too, but I figure my best bet was to buy seats along is usual entrance route and try for a fist bump.

AEWOfficial,9/14/2022 2:02,iobu5ty,princessfranchitti,"i saw that, but unfortunately don't care about any of them enough to buy the ticket for it. i appreciate you telling me about it though!

that's exactly where my seat is, haha. i never considered waiting outside the arena itself bad manners and/or stalkery though, do other people consider it that way?? obviously going to their hotel, the airport, following them to restaurants after the show, those are all bad manners unless you just happen to bump into them, but i've stood outside of an arena for many many shows and never had anyone say anything bad to me. of course, i'm also very quiet and respectful in these situations, would never scream at them or call them names for NOT coming over... these are things i've seen and it just makes me shake my head. they're people too!",iobsre2,"{""content"":""The OP does not want to buy tickets to see the wrestlers that he does not like."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The OP stresses that he has made efforts with the approach recommended by the hearer to see the wrestlers he likes."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The OP shows that he is aware of the issue of manners."", ""type"":""representatives""}",The OP shows that he is aware of the issue of manners.,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG,

AEWOfficial,9/14/2022 2:11,iobvdzc,sgtpepper220,"Certain talent don't mind a quick selfie if you happen to see them outside the arena, but certain do. I'm not sure what MVP arena is like since I'm coming up from CT, but I'd imagine it's not easy to get a big chance encounter like that. 

Forgot to mention initially that when I went to the show in CT earlier this year, Tony brought out Adam Cole for an exclusive promo and meet and greet after the show. I highly doubt Mox would be pulling extra duty in that role since he's supposed to be taking time off right now, but hopefully another big name will be out there for us.",iobu5ty,"{""content"":""The speaker suggests that a chance encounter for a quick selfie is OK in some arenas."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The speaker reminds the hearer that an after-show meet and greet is possible, but their favorite star may not appear."", ""type"":""representatives""}","The speaker reminds the hearer that an after-show meet and greet is possible, but their favorite star may not appear.",representatives,uncertain,IMP,NAG,

Yep. They just got off work. Would you want random strangers waiting for you once you got off work? They have paid meet and greets for a reason.

&gt;they're people too!

Agreed! If you want to meet them, attend a meet and greet.",iobu5ty,"{""content"":""The speaker thinks waiting outside the arena to meet the stars is bad manners and stalkery."", ""type"":""representatives""} ,{""content"":""The speaker does not think fans should expect a chance encounter after the stars get off work."", ""type"":""representative""},{""content"":""A meet and greet is part of the stars' work."", ""type"":""representatives""}",The speaker thinks waiting outside the arena to meet the stars is bad manners and stalkery.,representatives,no,IMP,NAG,

Celebrities are people too. They are tired after work and deserve privacy. If you want to meet your favorite, I suggest waiting for an opportunity to do so via a paid event. 

Sounds like your mind is already made up though, so I dunno why you’re seeking validation.",iobwr8x,"{""content"":""The speaker thinks that waiting outside the arena is rude and that wrestlers are not expected to anticipate their presence."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The speaker thinks that celebrities do not want to be seen after work."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The speaker thinks the OP wants to wait outside the arena after the show."", ""type"":""representatives""}",The speaker thinks that waiting outside the arena is rude and that wrestlers are not expected to anticipate their presence.,representatives,no,IMP,CAG,
AEWOfficial,9/14/2022 3:13,ioc3sgw,princessfranchitti,"i'm not seeking validation, i'm just confused by you saying that because this happens at almost every concert/play/live sporting event/comedy show/live celebrity event that has ever existed. all i wanted to know was if people did it for aew too and if they'd ever had success. i think the minute you leave the premises of the arena/theater/venue/whatever is when it become bad manners. most of the venues i've gone to for WWE have barricades set up outside the doors for this very purpose, so the wrestlers can come up to the barricade, sign things/take pictures, and go back inside/go home if it's after the event.",ioc0v9o,"{""content"":""The OP thinks it is a normal practice for people to wait outside the arenas to meet the celebrities after the shows."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The OP thinks it is proper to wait for the celebrities after the show when you have not left the premises of the arenas or events."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""Venues are even prepared for this kind of interactions between celebrities and fans after the shows."", ""type"":""representatives""} ",The OP thinks it is a normal practice for people to wait outside the arenas to meet the celebrities after the shows.,representatives,uncertain,IMP,NAG,
