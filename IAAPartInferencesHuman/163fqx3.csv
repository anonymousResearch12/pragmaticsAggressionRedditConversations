That's the point, even the slightest problem isn't worth it because it's all pointless anyway. Absence of good is not bad, but presence of bad is bad. It's not a hard idea to grasp, although uncomfortable one so your emotions might not allow you to get it.",163fqx3,"{""content"":""Emotions may prevent people from understanding some ideas."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""Even the presence of slightest problems makes it necessary to practice antinatalism."", ""type"":""representatives""}",Even the presence of slightest problems makes it necessary to practice antinatalism.,representatives,no,IMP,NAG,this speaker supports antinatalism.

antinatalism,8/28/2023 10:10,jy2c02j,Mountain-Day-6697,I have an actual question. Why don't you just kill yourself?

antinatalism,8/28/2023 10:17,jy2ch4z,KingGiuba,"Then why don't you ask the actual questions you have instead of attacking and insulting only because you don't understand? I can't answer you fully because I'm new to this philosophy, wait for someone that is more knowledgeable or make another post with the questions, I'm sure people will answer you without any attack, being antinatalist doesn't mean being a bad person, they literally want no one to suffer (but it's impossible if someone lives, so it's better not to be born).

And the mere fact that people should choose between dying or living is a choice that brings suffering, suicide should never be taken into consideration if life wasn't suffering, right? Idk if I'm explaining it in the right way... Anyway, I've never said I wish to die and I've never seen people here saying everyone should die right now, they just want people to stop making babies that are doomed to suffer anyway.",jy2c02j,"{""content"":""The speaker thinks that the hearer does not ask actual questions but attack and insult people."", ""type"":""expressives""},{""content"":""The speaker thinks that antinatalism is a philosophy with a good purpose."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The speaker tries to explain the philosophy of antinatalism while admitting uncertainty in the answer and stresses that he/she does not want to die and antinatalists do not preach suicide."", ""type"":""representatives""}",The speaker tries to explain the philosophy of antinatalism while admitting uncertainty in the answer and stresses that he/she does not want to die and antinatalists do not preach suicide.,representatives,no,IMP,NAG,
