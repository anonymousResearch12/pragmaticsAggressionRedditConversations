AskAnAustralian,,180yfp3,someothercrappyname,"""post_title"": Are Urbanworx Trail Cameras any good?

AskAnAustralian,11/22/2023 4:26,ka95q8p,observ4nt4nt,"I've done a bit of research during my phD using trail cameras to track feral animals. I got to speak to lots of camera experts and they'll all tell you the same thing. You get what you pay for. With trail cameras, cheap ones have slow reaction times, limited recording options, poor picture quality, short battery life etc. I looked up the brand you mentioned and checked some of the specs and I wouldn't buy one. But that's me. In my research I used Reconyx hyperfire cameras and never had a problem with any of them. Moultrie is another good brand.",180yfp3,"{""content"":""The speaker thinks that a lower budget means products of a lower quality."", ""type"":""representatives""}, {""content"":""The speaker thinks that camera experts would have the same advice as him/her."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The speaker does not think good of the brands mentioned by the OP."", ""type"":""expressives""}",The speaker thinks that a lower budget means products of a lower quality.,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG,
AskAnAustralian,11/22/2023 6:01,ka9gpyy,someothercrappyname,"Thanks for replying - and I know you're right - you get what you pay for.

Unfortunately I can't justify the nearly $700 they cost just so I can find out where the possums are getting into my roof and how the mice are managing to get up on my kitchen benches at night (little bastards)
