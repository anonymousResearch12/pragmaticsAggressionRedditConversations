AskIndia,,1hokyc4,multrix51,"""post_title"": Is there any NGO or groups organizing beach cleaning ?

""post_content"": I’m amazed by all the trash at mahabalipuram on the beach, while thousands of people come here as part of their pilgrim.

No one ever felt like it would be a good idea to make a group action and beach will be clean after 10 minutes of common effort ? As a foreigner I don’t feel like I should organize that. I hope that some locals sometimes do that. All India beaches and nature are just dump sites…",,"{""content"":""The OP thinks that it is easy to clean the beaches with group action and common effort."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The OP calls for the locals to organize group actions to clean the beaches of India."", ""type"":""directives""},{""content"":""The OP thinks that some NGO or groups may exist that can organize beach cleaning actions."", ""type"":""representatives""}",The OP thinks that some NGO or groups may exist that can organize beach cleaning actions.,representatives,no,IMP,NAG,

AskIndia,12/29/2024 2:58,m4afaqy,AnuNimasa,My point is it should happen with our tax money. Thats why we pay exorbitant taxes without complaining. And if its a serotonin based activity you want to perform you should do it yourself theres no harm in that. NGOs are just another way to perform scam like money laundering etc so i dont think that is going to cut it.
