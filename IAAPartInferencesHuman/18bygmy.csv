So, how can an argument against suicide, someone who does exist and want to leave existence, be an argument against not bring new people into existence?

Once a person exists, much more things have to be considered than just prevention of suffering. Active consent and self-determination for example.

No, and I am an Antinatalist, I'm just recounting the argument as I have seen it.

Antinatalists usually argue that the desire to procreate isn't a good enough reason to actually procreate, and that people should willingly choose to give up that desire in order to reduce suffering because suffering reduction is more important than the desire is.

This argument is then used to say that the desire to remain alive should also be superseded by a person willingly, and that they should *consent* to the ending of their own lives - either for the suffering in their own lives, or for the suffering that their lives cause.

We can probably remove 'consent' from the picture here because we are ultimately talking about whether people should willingly accept that suffering reduction is more important than *X* desire, not about the choice being forced onto them. The Antinatalist argument isn't generally that people should be forced into not procreating, and necessarily the ""why don't you kill yourself?"" crowd aren't saying that Antinatalists should be forcefully euthanised either, so consent is a bit of a red herring here it seems.

The question ultimately is this:

>Once a person exists, much more things have to be considered than just prevention of suffering.

What *X* should be considered by an existing person when deciding whether or not to take their own life is of more importance than suffering reduction if the desire to procreate is not of more importance than suffering reduction?

Of course, but in this hypothetical the argument is just the suffering reduction Antinatalist argument flipped on its head.

Continuing to exist causes suffering to other sentient beings, therefore it is immoral to continue to exist.

Does stopping to exist alleviate that suffering or maybe even cause more? What about the joy continued existence causes? Remember, you can't equate the hypothetical joy of a non-existent person to the joy of existing persons.

>Does stopping to exist alleviate that suffering or maybe even cause more? What about the joy continued existence causes?

Bringing joy into this equation begins to move us away from a purely suffering reduction framework. Doing so at least eliminates the views of people like Benatar, where even minor sufferings are not made less important to prevent by the presence of great joys.

These kinds of joys could be contrasted with the joys that procreation gives to the person through the satisfaction of their desire to procreate, or to the joy of the family and community around that person.

Either way there is the acceptance of one being's suffering in order that joy may be created in the lives of other people.

>I get your argument now, but there seems to be some trickery of words in there. Different meanings of ""cause"" and ""non-existence"" for example.

I don't see that there is any trickery or misuse of words. 

To cause something is, broadly, to bring it about through a course of action.
