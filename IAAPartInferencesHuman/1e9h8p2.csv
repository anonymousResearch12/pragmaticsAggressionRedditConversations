Askpolitics,7/23/2024 18:11,lekao2r,SpiceyMugwumpMomma,"Think about DHS as the Praetorian Guard.  Roman emperors were completely secure as long as they did exactly what the Praetorian Guard wanted.

The Praetorian guard was a “power” in Rome.  It existed in a power ecology alongside Roman politicians and foreign influences.  The Praetorian Guard, and the Emperor, both used and was used by these other powers to the mutual satisfaction of everyone’s lust for money and power.

“Bad” Emperors were executed first covertly then later quite publicly.  So that the next Emperor would be a “good” Emperor and do as directed.   Note that the Praetorian guard et. Al for a very long time demonstrated considerable skill in convincing the Roman public that the new Emperor was someone the Roman public chose, supported, and in service to them.

It should be noted that what got an Emperor executed speedily was trying to make real changes to alleviate the deep structural problems that plagued the Roman commoners.
