careerguidance,,vy84m9,HeavenlyRestrictionn,"""post_title"": How to make a career in ESG Finance?

""post_content"": I have a bachelor's in Economics and I wanted to have a career that would help me get into fields that are environmentally responsible and are involved in green technologies. But I also wanted to make decent money. ESG Finance could be one viable option but I don't know a lot about it. Are there any reputed graduate programs, charters, courses etc that would help me in getting into this field?",,"{""content"":""Working in fields that are environmentally responsible and involved in green technologies generally does not make money."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""ESG finance is a possible option that is environmentally responsible and involved in green technologies and enables one to make money."", ""type"":""representatives""}",ESG finance is a possible option that is environmentally responsible and involved in green technologies and enables one to make money.,representatives,no,IMP,NAG,

careerguidance,7/13/2022 21:42,ig172zs,GenoPax,"Accounting, forensic accounting I believe. 
Opinion: The good side is there seems to be no end to regulatory agencies using ESG as a way to control markets, so there probably is jobs that have legal and regulatory framework for NGOs like FATF, BIS etc. ESG largely uses financial weapons against small competitors so financial training in accounting would be useful to them. My opinion is current ESG helps large companies and governments to control consumers by eliminating competition and consumer liberty. Helping Exxon-Mobile and Blackrock investments is where most of ESG power comes from so those are the companies that would be the biggest employers is my guess outside of government.",ig115s1,"{""content"":""Regulatory agencies use ESG to control markets, making a career in this direction possible."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""Financial training in accounting is useful for finding a job in the ESG sector."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""Goverment and large companies are likely to have jobs that involve using ESG."", ""type"":""representatives""}","Regulatory agencies use ESG to control markets, making a career in this direction possible.",representatives,uncertain,IMP,NAG,
careerguidance,7/13/2022 21:57,ig19dmj,Medical_Elderberry27,"There is the CFA ESG Certification. 

Besides that, ESG is gaining a lot of traction and there are a lot of firms focussing on ESG. MSCI has it’s own set of ESG ratings and research. ISS has an entire suite of climate solutions. Sustainalytics is again focused entirely on ESG. All three are extremely profitable and dedicate a lot of resources researching on ESG.

Besides this, a lot of funds have to focus on ESG (due to regulation and client demands) and they do put a lot of emphasis on hiring folks knowledgeable about ESG and how ESG can be incorporated into the investment process.

That being said, the primary skillset is still finance and having knowledge of ESG is an add on, not a substitute.",vy84m9,"{""content"":""CFA ESG Certification could be a qualification for a job in this sector."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""There are some companies that make profits on ESG and dedicate resources on ESG research, which makes them potential employers.

And the full CFA charter is something that you can definitely pick up if you eventually plan to work in Investment Research and Asset Management. It does touch on ESG and how it can be used in investing. 

The best way to get to know how ESG is actually used is by working at a place that focuses on ESG and/or provides thematic investment strategies based on such factors.",ig1bq3g,"{""content"":""The best way to start is to work at a place that focuses on ESG rather than getting certifications."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""Some certifications are useful for the job."", ""type"":""representatives""}",Some certifications are useful for the job.,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG,
