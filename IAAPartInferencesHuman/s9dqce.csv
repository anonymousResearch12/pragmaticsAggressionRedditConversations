antinatalism,,s9dqce,PantherPower83,"""post_title"": Overpopulation and inflation.

""post_content"": Has anyone else noticed the obvious correlation between overpopulation and the inflation that has been happening as of lately? We can talk about supply and demand how it’s driving up the price for housing but the real culprit here is that there is simply too many people, too many people breeding recklessly and too many people who refuse to take these things into consideration. More land is being taken away and more plants and animals are being destroyed to build housing for selfish humans who breed recklessly without taking into account other species. Selfish humans to breed purely for their own egotistical reasons.",,"{""content"":""Overpopulation is caused by too many people breeding recklessly and too many people who refuse to take the consequences into consideration."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""Other species are destroyed to satisfy people's needs."", ""type"":""representatives""},{""content"":""The OP is angry with people's irresponsible behavior of overbreeding."", ""type"":""expressives""}",The OP is angry with people's irresponsible behavior of overbreeding.,expressives,no,IMP,OAG,

Does it look like inflation correlates to population to you? 

There are red bars on there for years with massive deflation. By your theory, those would be years of dropping population or something?
