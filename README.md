A corpus of pragmatics annotated in online reddit conversations 

What are pragmatic inferences?
To put it simply, non-literal meaning. It can be implicit assumptions that an interlocutor has or implied statement one can infer from the utterances. 

An example is: (message_id: kqc5065; thread id: 1aq8eut)
Great. Hopefully this sub will grow into a better representation for passport bros who are actively planning or have already had experiences abroad to share.
The other sub can try give more structure to discussions of home countries.
Looking forward to content from both and contributing to both.

The inferences given by GPT4 are: 
1. "There is optimism that the new sub will better represent the experiences of those who travel and date abroad.", "type": "expressives"; 
2. "The original sub was lacking in structure for discussions about home countries.", "type": "representatives";
3. "The user intends to contribute to both communities, indicating a commitment to constructive participation.", "type": "commissives".

Type refers to illocutionary act type in the framework by Searle (1975).

Among these inferences, the first one is the most salient (As this message has no replies, we refer to its parent message when selecting the most salient inference-- "Thank you for observing the rules. I will sticky this post." (message_id: kqbzsg8))

As the message has no replies, we put "yes" in the field "as intended", based on the assumption that if the other interlocutors do not agree, they will continue the discussion.

The most salient inference belongs to an implicature, because it is not an implicit assumption that must hold for the message to be true, but something that the message author conveys.

Clearly, this message is not toxic.
