AskLGBT,2023-06-25 01:31:55,jpemvy5,ActualPegasus,"As a disclaimer, I consider biological sex and gender to be two sides of the same coin. The only difference to me is using the former as an adjective and the latter as a noun. However, assigned sex/gender can be different from biological sex/gender.

Some trans people do consider themselves to be transsexual (as opposed to transgender) but it's fairly uncommon. The reason most prefer transgender is because -sexual tends to be heavily associated with sexualities, and by extension, intercourse.

I always take someone at face value when they tell me their gender and pronouns. If they're lying as a queerphobic ""gotcha"", they'll eventually get frustrated with me always referring to them as such and reveal their true gender and pronouns.

There are a few factors, but a driving factor is that the term transsexual which was the dominant term was then taken by cis people and used as a sort of slur. Many interviews with trans people from the 90s and before used the term transsexual. The transition did not have to do with sexuality but instead with cis people using the term as a slur and the community having to adapt. 

I recommend doing more research on trans history.

Second, gender isn’t based on physical characteristics because it’s an intuitive identity. But when a baby is born, we claim a gender for it based on physical characteristics. It’s a guess, since most people’s gender is consistent with their body. Sometimes the gender and sex don’t line up, and that person is trans.

There are actually multiple components that go into being a ""biological"" male or female. It's entirely possible that you could be assigned female at birth, your body can produce estrogen naturally, you can appear and *feel* like a woman -- but if you take a kareotype test, it could show you actually have XY chromosomes.

I'm not going to pretend that I am *especially* knowledgeable on the intricacies of this issue, but I encourage you to look into intersex educators to learn more about all the ways that ""biological sex"" doesn't equate to gender.

>how do you tell the difference between someone who identifies with a gender that isn't their biological sex and someone who is pretending/lying?

There has been an epidemic of trans women of color being murdered for years now in the United States, and for the past few that and accompanied hate crimes along with legislation have gotten MUCH worse. To come out as trans means that there is a greater risk of being physically or sexually attacked, kicked out, or killed than what LGB+s face.

In other words, virtually no one is dumb enough to lie or pretend.

If someone is *actively transitioning*, that is **ALWAYS** a good indicator that they aren't lying, for the sheer fact of how much vitriol they tend to face / be at threat of. Cis people who *know* they're cis are not ever going to be happy transitioning, and if they are pretending, it's not going to last long.",14i6qeb,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Explaining the complexity of biological sex and gender."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Highlighting the risks and challenges faced by trans individuals."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
