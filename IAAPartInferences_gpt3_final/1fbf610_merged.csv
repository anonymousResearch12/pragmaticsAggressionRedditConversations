adultery,,1fbf610,piriform1s,"""post_title"": Dayuse (rather, nightuse) for Intercontinental in London - actually for the whole night?

""post_content"": Wondering if I just inadvertently discovered a great loophole. Intercontinental in London offers a 1700 - 2200 slot for their dayuse. When I checked in, I noticed my registration form actually says I'm checking out the next day and no time is specified. I'm also wondering if they would really send someone to check you out at 10pm when it's the night shift crew and there's no housekeeping to tidy the room anyway, but I didn't stay in the room to find out. Anyone chanced this before and can confirm?",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author discovered a potential loophole in the hotel's dayuse policy."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author questions the likelihood of being checked out by the hotel staff at 10pm during the night shift."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author seeks confirmation from others who may have experienced a similar situation."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.75}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,NAG
