AskLesbians,,1g4230z,cumwash11,"""post_title"": Is it homophobic for me as a straight man to watch lesbian porn? 

""post_content"": As someone who wants to be an ally of the LGBT community, I figured it was best to ask people who are actually part of that community. I love you all, I vote Democrat every election, I'm always advocating for inclusion. With that said I do watch and enjoy lesbian porn. Is that disrespectful? Should I stop? The comfort of the good people in this community matters a lot to me so I will gladly do what I must. Thank you for hearing my question.
