""post_content"": My kid seems to have a great sense of social interaction and awareness, more so than his peers.

careerguidance,2023-11-19 18:53:48,k9ww9f6,FortySevenLifestyle,"You want to help your kid by showing them different career options. That's great & all, BUT there's a big difference between showing and telling. When you just ‚Äúshow‚Äù them jobs, you might accidentally push them towards what you think is best, not what they really like.

Here's another way to look at it: Letting your kid find and pick jobs that get them excited is actually a great idea. It's not about you not helping; it's about letting them find their own path. This way, they learn to make good choices and find out what they really love to do.

Your experience of not knowing many careers is completely invalid & irrelevant. This is not about you. YOU wish your parents could‚Äôve helped you- what if they ‚Äúhelped‚Äù you down the wrong path based on a bias they have? 

Suggesting that your kid should look for jobs that excite them isn't weird or wrong. It's actually a smart move. It helps them grow and become more independent, which is important for their future.

careerguidance,2023-11-19 19:11:13,k9wyplb,FortySevenLifestyle,"Stop hiding behind the word 'projecting' every time someone challenges your approach. This isn't about me projecting anything; it's about your method potentially limiting your child's future. You're so focused on your own experience and biases that you can't see how this might affect your kid. You're the one projecting your past onto them, not the other way around.

Your insistence on guiding them based on what you perceive as their strengths shows a lack of understanding of child development. Kids need to explore and find their own path, not be nudged down one you deem fit based on your experiences. This isn't about what you wish your parents did for you; it's about what's best for your child right now. (Deci & Ryan, 2000)

So, cut the 'projection' defense. It's not valid here. What's at stake is your child's autonomy and their right to choose a path that genuinely excites them, free from your biases. Your job is to support, not to steer.
