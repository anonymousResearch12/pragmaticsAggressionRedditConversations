That's the point, even the slightest problem isn't worth it because it's all pointless anyway. Absence of good is not bad, but presence of bad is bad. It's not a hard idea to grasp, although uncomfortable one so your emotions might not allow you to get it.",163fqx3,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Author argues that even minor problems are not worth attention as life is inherently pointless."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Author suggests that emotions may hinder understanding of uncomfortable truths."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.88}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

antinatalism,2023-08-28 10:02:35,jy2been,KingGiuba,"Bro if you think this will be able to change minds in any way you're delusional. And if you think people will get offended because a kid with no critical thinking wrote this you're really funny lol. Btw I'm not even an antinatalist, I just get these posts in my home, and I think attacking someone like this ""in their home"" is really low and embarrassing",163fqx3,,,,,,

antinatalism,2023-08-28 10:10:57,jy2c02j,Mountain-Day-6697,I have an actual question. Why don't you just kill yourself?

antinatalism,2023-08-28 10:17:28,jy2ch4z,KingGiuba,"Then why don't you ask the actual questions you have instead of attacking and insulting only because you don't understand? I can't answer you fully because I'm new to this philosophy, wait for someone that is more knowledgeable or make another post with the questions, I'm sure people will answer you without any attack, being antinatalist doesn't mean being a bad person, they literally want no one to suffer (but it's impossible if someone lives, so it's better not to be born).

And the mere fact that people should choose between dying or living is a choice that brings suffering, suicide should never be taken into consideration if life wasn't suffering, right? Idk if I'm explaining it in the right way... Anyway, I've never said I wish to die and I've never seen people here saying everyone should die right now, they just want people to stop making babies that are doomed to suffer anyway.",jy2c02j,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Author defends antinatalism and explains the philosophy's aim to reduce suffering."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
antinatalism,2023-08-28 10:17:57,jy2cidq,Mountain-Day-6697,Overcoming your problems is not anything impossible. Everyone since the dawn of humanity has been facing problems and you and your kids will not be the only one. I also think that problems make life more interesting because that's my only motivation of not just being like you because there is a reason to even try in this life.,jy2b9g2,,,,,,

antinatalism,2023-08-28 10:26:06,jy2d3li,Fuanshin,"I think if Earth was like Mars or Venus, the Solar System would be much better overall. Even if you overcome all your problems you will still have to get old and die and witness deaths of your friends and family. Funny how everyone saying 'it's worth it' is nowhere near close the ending. It's like saying 'this movie is so great, so worth it' when you know other people have said that ending is just sad and sucks and it's all pointless.",jy2cidq,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Author expresses a nihilistic view on life, highlighting the inevitability of death and suffering."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
