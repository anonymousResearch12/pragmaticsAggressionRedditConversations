AEWOfficial,,xdkybq,princessfranchitti,"""post_title"": meeting wrestlers before show?

""post_content"": hello everyone! i'm going to my first ever AEW show tomorrow in albany and i can't wait! i've been to a ton of WWE shows before and i know that if you get to the arena early, you can sometimes meet the wrestlers by the buses/stage door/whatever area it is that they enter through. i know people wait outside after the shows for this too. is this something that you can do with AEW too or is that not really a thing? i'm really just looking to meet mox, honestly. any information would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author is excited about attending their first AEW show."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author is interested in meeting the wrestler Mox."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author is seeking information on meeting wrestlers at the AEW show."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.75}}",1,expressives,yes,IMP,NAG

I'd love to meet Mox too, but I figure my best bet was to buy seats along is usual entrance route and try for a fist bump.

AEWOfficial,2022-09-14 02:02:20,iobu5ty,princessfranchitti,"i saw that, but unfortunately don't care about any of them enough to buy the ticket for it. i appreciate you telling me about it though!

that's exactly where my seat is, haha. i never considered waiting outside the arena itself bad manners and/or stalkery though, do other people consider it that way?? obviously going to their hotel, the airport, following them to restaurants after the show, those are all bad manners unless you just happen to bump into them, but i've stood outside of an arena for many many shows and never had anyone say anything bad to me. of course, i'm also very quiet and respectful in these situations, would never scream at them or call them names for NOT coming over... these are things i've seen and it just makes me shake my head. they're people too!",iobsre2,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author is not interested in purchasing meet and greet tickets for wrestlers."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author questions the perception of waiting outside the arena to meet wrestlers."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Certain wrestlers may not mind taking selfies with fans outside the arena."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.75}}",1,expressives,yes,IMP,NAG
AEWOfficial,2022-09-14 02:03:43,iobucai,princessfranchitti,"better than WWE's current setup, you pay $500-$600 (can't remember which) and you DO get a really really good floor seat, but with the meet and greet, you have no idea who's coming until you're there. i'm not about to spend $600 just to meet someone i have no interest in, i'd much rather pay $200 and KNOW i was going to meet my favorite, haha.",iobt95y,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author finds WWE's meet and greet setup expensive."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author is a big fan of Mox."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}}",1,expressives,yes,IMP,NAG

AEWOfficial,2022-09-14 02:11:33,iobvdzc,sgtpepper220,"Certain talent don't mind a quick selfie if you happen to see them outside the arena, but certain do. I'm not sure what MVP arena is like since I'm coming up from CT, but I'd imagine it's not easy to get a big chance encounter like that. 

Forgot to mention initially that when I went to the show in CT earlier this year, Tony brought out Adam Cole for an exclusive promo and meet and greet after the show. I highly doubt Mox would be pulling extra duty in that role since he's supposed to be taking time off right now, but hopefully another big name will be out there for us.",iobu5ty,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Certain wrestlers may allow quick selfies outside the arena."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author doubts Mox will have extra duties at the upcoming event."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

Yep. They just got off work. Would you want random strangers waiting for you once you got off work? They have paid meet and greets for a reason.

&gt;they're people too!

Agreed! If you want to meet them, attend a meet and greet.",iobu5ty,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Waiting outside the arena to meet wrestlers may be considered bad manners."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Paid meet and greets are organized for a reason."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
AEWOfficial,2022-09-14 02:21:39,iobwr8x,princessfranchitti,"well i would purchase a paid meet and greet if my favorite was part of it! i know i'm not entitled to anything and completely understand if they don't want to stop and take a picture. random strangers wouldn't wait for me when i get off work because i'm not a celebrity. i think right outside the arena, it's kind of something they have to expect people are waiting for. doesn't mean they have to even look at those people, but i think calling the people standing out there stalkery is going a tiny bit far.",iobwbss,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author would attend a paid meet and greet if their favorite wrestler was part of it."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author believes waiting outside the arena is expected by wrestlers."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}}",1,expressives,yes,IMP,NAG
AEWOfficial,2022-09-14 02:51:54,ioc0v9o,slujj-vohaul,"I didn’t call it stalkery, that was another person. But I do think it’s kinda rude and wrestlers certainly shouldn’t “expect it”.

Celebrities are people too. They are tired after work and deserve privacy. If you want to meet your favorite, I suggest waiting for an opportunity to do so via a paid event. 

Sounds like your mind is already made up though, so I dunno why you’re seeking validation.",iobwr8x,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author believes waiting for wrestlers outside the arena is rude."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Celebrities deserve privacy and respect after work."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
