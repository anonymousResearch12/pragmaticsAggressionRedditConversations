careerguidance,,vy84m9,HeavenlyRestrictionn,"""post_title"": How to make a career in ESG Finance?

""post_content"": I have a bachelor's in Economics and I wanted to have a career that would help me get into fields that are environmentally responsible and are involved in green technologies. But I also wanted to make decent money. ESG Finance could be one viable option but I don't know a lot about it. Are there any reputed graduate programs, charters, courses etc that would help me in getting into this field?",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author is interested in pursuing a career in ESG Finance."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.95}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author values environmentally responsible fields and green technologies."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author seeks information on reputed graduate programs, charters, and courses related to ESG Finance."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

careerguidance,2022-07-13 21:42:48,ig172zs,GenoPax,"Accounting, forensic accounting I believe. 
Opinion: The good side is there seems to be no end to regulatory agencies using ESG as a way to control markets, so there probably is jobs that have legal and regulatory framework for NGOs like FATF, BIS etc. ESG largely uses financial weapons against small competitors so financial training in accounting would be useful to them. My opinion is current ESG helps large companies and governments to control consumers by eliminating competition and consumer liberty. Helping Exxon-Mobile and Blackrock investments is where most of ESG power comes from so those are the companies that would be the biggest employers is my guess outside of government.",ig115s1,,,,,,
careerguidance,2022-07-13 21:57:46,ig19dmj,Medical_Elderberry27,"There is the CFA ESG Certification. 

Besides that, ESG is gaining a lot of traction and there are a lot of firms focussing on ESG. MSCI has it’s own set of ESG ratings and research. ISS has an entire suite of climate solutions. Sustainalytics is again focused entirely on ESG. All three are extremely profitable and dedicate a lot of resources researching on ESG.

Besides this, a lot of funds have to focus on ESG (due to regulation and client demands) and they do put a lot of emphasis on hiring folks knowledgeable about ESG and how ESG can be incorporated into the investment process.

That being said, the primary skillset is still finance and having knowledge of ESG is an add on, not a substitute.",vy84m9,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author mentions the CFA ESG Certification as an option."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author highlights the increasing focus on ESG in various firms and funds."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
careerguidance,2022-07-13 22:12:57,ig1bq3g,HeavenlyRestrictionn,I've been told that the CFA ESG certification is a waste of money. Is it true? Does it make more sense to go for a full fledged CFA Charter? Or is the GARP SCR a better option?,ig19dmj,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author questions the value of the CFA ESG Certification."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author considers the option of pursuing a full CFA Charter or GARP SCR instead."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}}",1,expressives,yes,IMP,NAG
careerguidance,2022-07-13 22:39:27,ig1ftng,Medical_Elderberry27,"I really haven’t given the ESG Certification so I really can’t comment much on it.

And the full CFA charter is something that you can definitely pick up if you eventually plan to work in Investment Research and Asset Management. It does touch on ESG and how it can be used in investing. 

The best way to get to know how ESG is actually used is by working at a place that focuses on ESG and/or provides thematic investment strategies based on such factors.",ig1bq3g,,,,,,

careerguidance,2022-07-14 10:55:08,ig3sdg9,True-Musician-5406,It’s objectively true whether rude or not. ESG is notttt where the money is (I truly don’t think so).  I would think a little deeper/more and come up with some (at least) potential new lines of business where economic skills can be applied other than ESG…then if it still makes most sense…id run with it.,ig3pdni,,,,,,
