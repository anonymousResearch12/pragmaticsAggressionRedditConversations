AskIndia,,1hokyc4,multrix51,"""post_title"": Is there any NGO or groups organizing beach cleaning ?

""post_content"": I‚Äôm amazed by all the trash at mahabalipuram on the beach, while thousands of people come here as part of their pilgrim.

No one ever felt like it would be a good idea to make a group action and beach will be clean after 10 minutes of common effort ? As a foreigner I don‚Äôt feel like I should organize that. I hope that some locals sometimes do that. All India beaches and nature are just dump sites‚Ä¶",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""The author is amazed by the amount of trash on the beach at Mahabalipuram."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""The author questions why there is no group action to clean the beach despite the large number of visitors."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}, ""3"": {""content"": ""The author expresses disappointment in the cleanliness of Indian beaches and nature."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.75}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

AskIndia,2024-12-29 02:58:28,m4afaqy,AnuNimasa,My point is it should happen with our tax money. Thats why we pay exorbitant taxes without complaining. And if its a serotonin based activity you want to perform you should do it yourself theres no harm in that. NGOs are just another way to perform scam like money laundering etc so i dont think that is going to cut it.
