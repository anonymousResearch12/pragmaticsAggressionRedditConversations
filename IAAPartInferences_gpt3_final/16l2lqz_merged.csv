""post_content"": Gooooood morning yall,

Does anyone know of any WFH writing careers/job types that pay well from their own personal experience? I'm personally a well fleshed out writer who could produce quality deliverables with a quick turnaround.

I have some college experience (had to drop out due to medical reasons, among others) and I feel that I can craft a resume that can be blasted out online.

I've done some very basic research into copywriting but I was curious if anyone else had advice? Not sure if a degree is necessary in general for this vein of work but I'm curious to find out.

Not sure if that's a reasonable understanding on that side of things but it seems a rough estimate to me.

As for a portfolio, I could delve into my previous writings or create new pieces/examples as needed. Not entirely sure of the details employers are looking for when it comes to this though.
