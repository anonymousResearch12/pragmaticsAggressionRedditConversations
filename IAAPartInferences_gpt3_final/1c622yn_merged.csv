""post_content"": I work as a bouncer for a bar near a uni and I've been noticing a large increase in terrible quality digital fake ids floating around. Has anyone else noticed this? Im not exactly sure about policies when it comes to confiscating ""digital fake ids"" and will ask the boss soon enough. This is a bit of a special case because this is quite a recent trend but I was wondering if anyone had as similar experience or any tips when it comes to dealing with digital fakies?",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Increase in terrible quality digital fake IDs floating around."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Uncertainty about policies for confiscating digital fake IDs."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Seeking advice and tips on dealing with digital fake IDs."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.75}}",1,representatives,uncertain,IMP,NAG

Likewise if you tried to gain unauthorised access to a digital device that would also be a criminal offence.


You would also be opening yourself up to all sorts of allegations ranging trying to use their banking app thru to looking at their private photos.

That's an easy case to solve with find my phone and your pub CCTV, but if you used threat or intimidation to take it then the charge would robbery not theft. Your employer could also be charged or sued too and you are massive liability if you think you can act like that.


Also if someone is using a fake ID they are probably underage and have nudes on their phone. You see where I am going here? How is it going to look when a crying underage girl claims you stole her phone to get access to her nudes and the phone as well as the photos are in your possession? Even an allegation like that could be enough to ruin your life.

Yes theft cases go unsolved because it’s hard to prove or follow up on, a bouncer openly stealing your phone is recorded on camera and has their name and everything else tied to it. It also opens the security company or establishment up for lawsuits
