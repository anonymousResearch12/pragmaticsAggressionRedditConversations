canadahousing,,12u91dp,Ok_Pen608,"""post_title"": property sold buy power of sale

""post_content"": I've found 2 properties sold buy power of sale.
One from creditors
The other I have not had a response yet.


Am I allowed to ask Tennant's bank drafts to check for payement history? 


How does one go to do the verifications on these kind of property.

Even if I theoretically owned a house, I did not have the time to do upkeep/maintenance on it or the property. Furthermore, the taxes and inevitable surprise costs of home ownership would have been very unwelcome early on in my career.

My bad landlord sucked massive donkey balls and if I had the time and knowledge that I fo now I absolutely could have gone to the LTB about it.

canadahousing,2023-04-22 01:32:07,jh7ipq1,JohnnyManu40,"By your logic displayed here, all services rendered and all products purchased are just a leeching of ones paycheck.

I give it to you that when people take things to an extreme and turn property ownership into a game of monopoly that it becomes toxic, and that they certainly are taking more than is fair for what they are contributing to society.

But whether you like it or not; your opinion as to what is or is not fair is not valid. Even if you were to somehow come up with the most perfectly correct opinion; the chances of that occurring are slim to none. And no, your current displayed opinion is not the winning one.

What is closer to a winning opinion, is that maybe perhaps we put some regulations in motion that limit how many properties a person can own and rent out at the same time; whilst also creating a new measure of oversight to ensure compliance. This combined with a minimum and maximum threshold for what is considered 'fair rent', should mostly make this problem a thing of the past.

But even what I just said isn't perfect. It can still be abused if we allow it to be. Which is the real fault at hand here.

None of this would be as bad as it is, if people weren't so damn complacent for decades on end. All of you complaining today are literally the boiled frogs in the water. You could have ribbited a long time before; but you took too long and now your croaked.

And if you think you are the 'right people' with the 'right reasons' just wait til you find out how wrong you are.

Are you cognitively dissonant or something?

No seriously, really. It's an honest question. You push the idea that earning something for having done nothing or leeching from society is vile; but then push dividend stocks and ETF's?

Do you follow as to why this does not compute? Personally I don't see either as vile, but if you are going to be coherent in your displayed virtues; perhaps don't preach hypocrisy?
