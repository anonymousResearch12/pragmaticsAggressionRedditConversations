So, how can an argument against suicide, someone who does exist and want to leave existence, be an argument against not bring new people into existence?

Once a person exists, much more things have to be considered than just prevention of suffering. Active consent and self-determination for example.

No, and I am an Antinatalist, I'm just recounting the argument as I have seen it.

Antinatalists usually argue that the desire to procreate isn't a good enough reason to actually procreate, and that people should willingly choose to give up that desire in order to reduce suffering because suffering reduction is more important than the desire is.

This argument is then used to say that the desire to remain alive should also be superseded by a person willingly, and that they should *consent* to the ending of their own lives - either for the suffering in their own lives, or for the suffering that their lives cause.

We can probably remove 'consent' from the picture here because we are ultimately talking about whether people should willingly accept that suffering reduction is more important than *X* desire, not about the choice being forced onto them. The Antinatalist argument isn't generally that people should be forced into not procreating, and necessarily the ""why don't you kill yourself?"" crowd aren't saying that Antinatalists should be forcefully euthanised either, so consent is a bit of a red herring here it seems.

The question ultimately is this:

>Once a person exists, much more things have to be considered than just prevention of suffering.

What *X* should be considered by an existing person when deciding whether or not to take their own life is of more importance than suffering reduction if the desire to procreate is not of more importance than suffering reduction?

antinatalism,2023-12-06 12:15:12,kc7plf1,Cubusphere,"My pro-suicide stance doesn't require any prevention of suffering. A person that exists can decide for ANY reason that they don't want to exist anymore. (Measures to ensure that the decision is indeed made consciously aside).

The two decisions are just not equivalent. Even if suffering is the motivator for both, in one case it's one's own suffering and in the other the suffering of someone else.

The premise is unsound in the first place. Only if the suffering of the SAME person was the ONLY justification would that begin to make sense.",kc7o0nv,,,,,,

Of course, but in this hypothetical the argument is just the suffering reduction Antinatalist argument flipped on its head.

Yes, but what is the fundamental difference between suffering caused to another by procreation and the suffering caused to others by remaining alive in a world where one's continued existence causes suffering?",kc7plf1,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Comparing the morality of causing suffering to oneself versus causing suffering to others."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

antinatalism,2023-12-06 12:41:08,kc7rq4c,Ilalotha,"I think you have misunderstood my point.

Procreation causes suffering to the sentient being that is brought into existence, therefore it is immoral to bring that sentient being into existence.

Continuing to exist causes suffering to other sentient beings, therefore it is immoral to continue to exist.

Unless there is a fundamental difference between these acts of causing suffering where the first is *unacceptable* in spite of the desire to procreate, and the second is *acceptable* due to *X* desire being used as a reason to remain alive.",kc7r382,,,,,,

Does stopping to exist alleviate that suffering or maybe even cause more? What about the joy continued existence causes? Remember, you can't equate the hypothetical joy of a non-existent person to the joy of existing persons.

>Does stopping to exist alleviate that suffering or maybe even cause more? What about the joy continued existence causes?

Bringing joy into this equation begins to move us away from a purely suffering reduction framework. Doing so at least eliminates the views of people like Benatar, where even minor sufferings are not made less important to prevent by the presence of great joys.

These kinds of joys could be contrasted with the joys that procreation gives to the person through the satisfaction of their desire to procreate, or to the joy of the family and community around that person.

Either way there is the acceptance of one being's suffering in order that joy may be created in the lives of other people.

>I get your argument now, but there seems to be some trickery of words in there. Different meanings of ""cause"" and ""non-existence"" for example.

I don't see that there is any trickery or misuse of words. 

To cause something is, broadly, to bring it about through a course of action.

I see some utility in continued existence that simply doesn't apply to antinatalism because it is concerned with the non-existent. I refute the premise that it has to be the exact same framework to justify both suicide and non-procreation.",kc7v4n3,,,,,,
