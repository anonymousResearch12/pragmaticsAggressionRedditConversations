AskAnAustralian,2023-11-22 04:26:45,ka95q8p,observ4nt4nt,"I've done a bit of research during my phD using trail cameras to track feral animals. I got to speak to lots of camera experts and they'll all tell you the same thing. You get what you pay for. With trail cameras, cheap ones have slow reaction times, limited recording options, poor picture quality, short battery life etc. I looked up the brand you mentioned and checked some of the specs and I wouldn't buy one. But that's me. In my research I used Reconyx hyperfire cameras and never had a problem with any of them. Moultrie is another good brand.",180yfp3,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Reconyx hyperfire cameras are recommended for quality."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.92}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Cheap trail cameras have limitations like slow reaction times, poor picture quality, and short battery life."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.88}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
AskAnAustralian,2023-11-22 06:01:05,ka9gpyy,someothercrappyname,"Thanks for replying - and I know you're right - you get what you pay for.

Unfortunately I can't justify the nearly $700 they cost just so I can find out where the possums are getting into my roof and how the mice are managing to get up on my kitchen benches at night (little bastards)

But thanks anyway :-)",ka95q8p,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Price does not always correlate with quality in trail cameras."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Inability to justify the high cost of Reconyx hyperfire cameras."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG

AskAnAustralian,2023-11-22 10:37:15,kaa4he2,GetlostMaps,"Yes, I was one of them. Camera trap based research all over the place. They/we don't know any more about cameras than anyone else. Usually, less, and collected from biased commercial sources, mainly the guy who sold us the camera. There are fewer people in Australia I actually trust with this stuff to be knowledgeable and unbiased than I have fingers on one hand.",kaa02vz,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Distrust towards biased commercial sources for camera information."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
