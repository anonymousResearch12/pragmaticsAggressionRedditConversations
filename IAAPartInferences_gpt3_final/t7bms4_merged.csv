AskARussian,,t7bms4,pinkhairedbiatch,"""post_title"": Russian artists of reddit: how have the sanctions impacted you?

""post_content"": I had tickets to a Russian ballet in my town, but it got cancelled because of the war. It's sad, since it's not the ballerinas' fault that their leader is a dictator, as a former ballerina myself knowing the amount of time, pain and effort it takes physically hurts.

So how are other artists affected? Singers? Actors? Actresses? Maybe even some dancers are here? Or other artists of the sort? How does it make you feel and how do you cope?",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Sanctions impacting Russian artists, cancellation of events due to war."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 0.9}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Expression of empathy towards artists affected by sanctions and war."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 0.85}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Seeking input from other artists on how they are coping with the situation."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 0.8}}",1,representatives,yes,IMP,NAG
