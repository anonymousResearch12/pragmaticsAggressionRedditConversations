Look at your post.
You literally claim to be treated worse because you are a foreigner, while other lesser valuable people( according to your skewed ranking system) are treated better by state officials.

And again you never told us which officials did this.
You didn't tell us where it happened.
You didn't tell us what exactly happened.

How are we supposed to give you an honest answer without all these informations. Because yes maybe you did something wrong or suspicious?
Something you weren't aware of? Something someone could answer if you actually would tell us the INFORMATION.
