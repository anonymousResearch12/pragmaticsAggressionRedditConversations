""post_content"": I have a bachelor's in Economics and I wanted to have a career that would help me get into fields that are environmentally responsible and are involved in green technologies. But I also wanted to make decent money. ESG Finance could be one viable option but I don't know a lot about it.

Opinion: The good side is there seems to be no end to regulatory agencies using ESG as a way to control markets, so there probably is jobs that have legal and regulatory framework for NGOs like FATF, BIS etc. ESG largely uses financial weapons against small competitors so financial training in accounting would be useful to them. My opinion is current ESG helps large companies and governments to control consumers by eliminating competition and consumer liberty. Helping Exxon-Mobile and Blackrock investments is where most of ESG power comes from so those are the companies that would be the biggest employers is my guess outside of government.",ig115s1,"{""1"": {""content"": ""ESG serves as a market-control tool favoring large incumbents and curbing small competitors/consumer liberty."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Pursue accounting/forensic accounting for ESG-related regulatory/NGO roles."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 78}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Major ESG employment lies with big firms and government rather than idealistic challengers."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 77}}",2,directives,uncertain,IMP,NAG

Besides that, ESG is gaining a lot of traction and there are a lot of firms focussing on ESG. MSCI has it’s own set of ESG ratings and research. ISS has an entire suite of climate solutions. Sustainalytics is again focused entirely on ESG. All three are extremely profitable and dedicate a lot of resources researching on ESG.

Besides this, a lot of funds have to focus on ESG (due to regulation and client demands) and they do put a lot of emphasis on hiring folks knowledgeable about ESG and how ESG can be incorporated into the investment process.

That being said, the primary skillset is still finance and having knowledge of ESG is an add on, not a substitute.",vy84m9,"{""1"": {""content"": ""ESG has strong traction; major firms are profitable and invest heavily in ESG research."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 88}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Treat ESG knowledge as an add-on; build core finance skills first."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 84}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Regulation and client demand force funds to hire ESG-savvy talent."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 85}, ""4"": {""content"": ""The CFA ESG Certification is a recognized credential option."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 90}}",4,representatives,no,IMP,NAG

And the full CFA charter is something that you can definitely pick up if you eventually plan to work in Investment Research and Asset Management. It does touch on ESG and how it can be used in investing.
