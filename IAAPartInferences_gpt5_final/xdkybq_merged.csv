AEWOfficial,,xdkybq,princessfranchitti,"""post_title"": meeting wrestlers before show?

""post_content"": hello everyone! i'm going to my first ever AEW show tomorrow in albany and i can't wait! i've been to a ton of WWE shows before and i know that if you get to the arena early, you can sometimes meet the wrestlers by the buses/stage door/whatever area it is that they enter through. i know people wait outside after the shows for this too. is this something that you can do with AEW too or is that not really a thing? i'm really just looking to meet mox, honestly. any information would be greatly appreciated, thank you!",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Assumes AEW might allow informal fan access near buses/doors similar to WWE."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Signals willingness to invest time/effort to meet Mox specifically."", ""type"": ""commissives"", ""confidence"": 75}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Treats waiting near venue entrances as a socially acceptable norm for fans."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 80}}",3,representatives,no,IMP,NAG

I'd love to meet Mox too, but I figure my best bet was to buy seats along is usual entrance route and try for a fist bump.

that's exactly where my seat is, haha. i never considered waiting outside the arena itself bad manners and/or stalkery though, do other people consider it that way?? obviously going to their hotel, the airport, following them to restaurants after the show, those are all bad manners unless you just happen to bump into them, but i've stood outside of an arena for many many shows and never had anyone say anything bad to me. of course, i'm also very quiet and respectful in these situations, would never scream at them or call them names for NOT coming over... these are things i've seen and it just makes me shake my head. they're people too!",iobsre2,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Draws an etiquette boundary: on-venue waiting is acceptable; hotels/airports/restaurants are not."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 88}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Presents self as a respectful fan to legitimize seeking informal interaction."", ""type"": ""expressives"", ""confidence"": 78}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Intends to maximize proximity (seat on entrance route) to increase chances of interaction."", ""type"": ""commissives"", ""confidence"": 72}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,NAG

Forgot to mention initially that when I went to the show in CT earlier this year, Tony brought out Adam Cole for an exclusive promo and meet and greet after the show.

Yep. They just got off work. Would you want random strangers waiting for you once you got off work? They have paid meet and greets for a reason.

Agreed!

AEWOfficial,2022-09-14 02:51:54,ioc0v9o,slujj-vohaul,"I didn’t call it stalkery, that was another person. But I do think it’s kinda rude and wrestlers certainly shouldn’t “expect it”.

Celebrities are people too. They are tired after work and deserve privacy. If you want to meet your favorite, I suggest waiting for an opportunity to do so via a paid event. 

Sounds like your mind is already made up though, so I dunno why you’re seeking validation.",iobwr8x,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Rejects the expectation that wrestlers should anticipate fans waiting; frames it as rude."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 88}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Advises using paid events to meet wrestlers and respecting post-work privacy."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 90}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Imputes that the OP seeks validation rather than information."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 70}}",3,representatives,no,IMP,CAG
