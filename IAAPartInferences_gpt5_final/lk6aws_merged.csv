""post_content"": The verdict is I don't know. I was unconscious the whole time so I can't know. I can't say that he did assault me and I can't say he didn't assault me. I don't have any real memories from when I was unconscious.

TwoXChromosomes,2021-02-15 13:35:12,gnj23hh,[deleted],"You do know. Nobody in their right mind would do that. Even if you can't know if they assaulted you, you know they have boundary issues. Everyone knows that you're not supposed to ""just climb into someone's bed"". Hell, I wouldn't even do it to my female friends, when I am a female myself. BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE PERSONAL SPACE. And personal space needs to be respected. The only time you can sleep next to someone is when you get their consent for it. Even if just sleeping next to someone is not a crime, it's also not socially acceptable. Regardless of what happened, I would feel unsafe and I would never talk to that person again and would tell everyone in my close vicinity about what happened so that they could avoid that person.",gnih9in,"{""1"": {""content"": ""States a strong norm: sharing a bed without explicit consent is unacceptable and signals boundary issues."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 85}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Urges OP to cut off contact and warn others to avoid the person."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Challenges OP\u2019s uncertainty, implying they \u2018do know\u2019 it was a serious violation."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 70}, ""4"": {""content"": ""Uses self-example to universalize consent norms even among friends."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 75}}",2,directives,no,IMP,CAG

TwoXChromosomes,2021-02-16 10:38:47,gnmqcpc,[deleted],"Why are you trying to pretend that it's ok for someone else to climb into your bed? As I said, they can't know if anything happened. It could have been that the person truly just did sleep next to them and didn't even touch them. But for me, that's a MAJOR red flag, especially if you don't know them or they're just some random person from school/work/hobby etc. Amd I would warn all of my friends that if you pass out next to that dude, they can end up in your bed.",gnl8pow,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Frames the other commenter as enabling by \u2018pretending it\u2019s ok\u2019 to climb into someone\u2019s bed."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""2"": {""content"": ""Advocates warning peers and treating the person as high-risk even without proof of assault."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 80}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Affirms a categorical boundary norm: co-sleeping without consent is not acceptable."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 85}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,CAG

TwoXChromosomes,2021-02-16 11:06:18,gnms169,[deleted],"I just agreed with the previous person that that dude is a scumbag. Sure, they might not have done anything but they're definitely not people you would like to hang around with. Could they be awesome and they just had a weird lapse of judgement and didn't think? Sure. But is it worth it being around a person that did a super sketchy thing just because there's a chance they're cool? In my opinion, no.
