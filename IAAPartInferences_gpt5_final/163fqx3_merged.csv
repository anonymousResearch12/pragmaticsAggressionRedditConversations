antinatalism,2023-08-28 10:10:57,jy2c02j,Mountain-Day-6697,I have an actual question. Why don't you just kill yourself?

antinatalism,2023-08-28 10:17:28,jy2ch4z,KingGiuba,"Then why don't you ask the actual questions you have instead of attacking and insulting only because you don't understand? I can't answer you fully because I'm new to this philosophy, wait for someone that is more knowledgeable or make another post with the questions, I'm sure people will answer you without any attack, being antinatalist doesn't mean being a bad person, they literally want no one to suffer (but it's impossible if someone lives, so it's better not to be born).

And the mere fact that people should choose between dying or living is a choice that brings suffering, suicide should never be taken into consideration if life wasn't suffering, right?
