antinatalism,,s9dqce,PantherPower83,"""post_title"": Overpopulation and inflation.

""post_content"": Has anyone else noticed the obvious correlation between overpopulation and the inflation that has been happening as of lately? We can talk about supply and demand how it’s driving up the price for housing but the real culprit here is that there is simply too many people, too many people breeding recklessly and too many people who refuse to take these things into consideration. More land is being taken away and more plants and animals are being destroyed to build housing for selfish humans who breed recklessly without taking into account other species. Selfish humans to breed purely for their own egotistical reasons.",,"{""1"": {""content"": ""Macroeconomic inflation, especially housing prices, is primarily driven by overpopulation rather than typical monetary or cyclical factors."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 88}, ""2"": {""content"": ""People who choose to have children are acting selfishly and irresponsibly by ignoring environmental and social externalities."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 84}, ""3"": {""content"": ""Human reproductive behavior should be curtailed or made more conscientious to protect resources and nonhuman species."", ""type"": ""directives"", ""confidence"": 82}, ""4"": {""content"": ""Habitat loss and biodiversity destruction are substantially caused by housing expansion to accommodate population growth."", ""type"": ""representatives"", ""confidence"": 86}}",1,representatives,no,IMP,CAG

Does it look like inflation correlates to population to you? 

There are red bars on there for years with massive deflation. By your theory, those would be years of dropping population or something?
