AskIndia,,1hokyc4,multrix51,"""post_title"": Is there any NGO or groups organizing beach cleaning ?

""post_content"": I‚Äôm amazed by all the trash at mahabalipuram on the beach, while thousands of people come here as part of their pilgrim.

No one ever felt like it would be a good idea to make a group action and beach will be clean after 10 minutes of common effort ? As a foreigner I don‚Äôt feel like I should organize that. I hope that some locals sometimes do that.

AskIndia,2024-12-29 02:58:28,m4afaqy,AnuNimasa,My point is it should happen with our tax money. Thats why we pay exorbitant taxes without complaining.
