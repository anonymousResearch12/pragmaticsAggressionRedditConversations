That's an easy case to solve with find my phone and your pub CCTV, but if you used threat or intimidation to take it then the charge would robbery not theft. Your employer could also be charged or sued too and you are massive liability if you think you can act like that.


Also if someone is using a fake ID they are probably underage and have nudes on their phone. You see where I am going here? How is it going to look when a crying underage girl claims you stole her phone to get access to her nudes and the phone as well as the photos are in your possession?
