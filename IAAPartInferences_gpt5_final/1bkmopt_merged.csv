AfterMidnight,,1bkmopt,Pin-Last,"""post_title"": I’d post about the Jeff Probst episode…

""post_content"": …but I can only take so many downvotes before I get the hint. 
I literally can’t find a bigger Taylor fan than me. 
It’s true love.

There's a lot to love about her, but to be completely frank, you're starting to sound a bit creepy with just how much you're into her. Please dial it back some, and promise yourself that you'll never try to find her IRL.
